Classes:
- Agent
- BusinessEntity
- Concept
- Format type: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:MediaTypeTable.
- Impiego: A Post represents some position within an organization that exists independently of the person or persons filling it. Posts may be used to represent situations where a person is a member of an organization ex officio (for example the Secretary of State for Scotland is part of UK Cabinet by virtue of being Secretary of State for Scotland, not as an individual person). A post can be held by multiple people and hence can be treated as a organization in its own right.
- In force: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:InForceTable
- Membership: Indicates the nature of an Agent's membership of an organization. Represents an n-ary relation between an Agent, an Organization and a Role. It is possible to directly indicate membership, independent of the specific Role, through use of the `org:memberOf` property.
- Organization
- Organization
- OrganizationalUnit: An Organization such as a University Support Unit which is part of some larger FormalOrganization and only has full recognition within the context of that FormalOrganization, it is not a Legal Entity in its own right. Units can be large and complex containing other Units and even FormalOrganizations. Alternative names: _OU_ _Unit_ _Department_
- Partenariat: A collaboration between two or more Organizations such as a project. It meets the criteria for being an Organization in that it has an identity and defining purpose independent of its particular members but is neither a formally recognized legal entity nor a sub-unit within some larger organization. Might typically have a shorter lifetime than the Organizations within it, but not necessarily. All members are `org:Organization`s rather than individuals and those Organizations can play particular roles within the venture. Alternative names: _Project_ _Venture_  _Endeavour_ _Consortium_ _Endeavour_
- Person
- Rôle: Denotes a role that a Person or other Agent can take in an organization. Instances of this class describe the abstract role; to denote a specific instance of a person playing that role in a specific organization use an instance of `org:Membership`. It is common for roles to be arranged in some taxonomic structure and we use SKOS to represent that. The normal SKOS lexical properties should be used when labelling the Role. Additional descriptive properties for the Role, such as a Salary band, may be added by extension vocabularies.
- Sede: An office or other premise at which the organization is located. Many organizations are spread across multiple sites and many sites will host multiple locations. In most cases a Site will be a physical location. However, we don't exclude the possibility of non-physical sites such as a virtual office with an associated post box and phone reception service. Extensions may provide subclasses to denote particular types of site.
- organización formal: An Organization which is recognized in the world at large, in particular in legal jurisdictions, with associated rights and responsibilities. Examples include a Corporation, Charity, Government or Church. Note that this is a super class of `gr:BusinessEntity` and it is recommended to use the GoodRelations vocabulary to denote Business classifications such as DUNS or NAICS.

Classes:
- Agent: An agent is any owl:Thing which can act, i.e. play the 'actor' role wrt. an action
- Belief: Someting an agent 'believes in', i.e. holds as true
- Communicated_Attitude: A communictated attitude is a propositional attitude involved in an act of communication.
- Desire: A feeling of wanting
- Evaluative_Attitude: An evaluative attitude expresses e.g. a judgment. The proposition qualified by the evaluative attitude is comparable to something else.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Intention: Intention is where the agent expects certain consequences of his or her actions and desires those consequences to occur. This concept must be related to qualification and preference in some way.
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Organisation: An organisation is a group of other organisations or persons which acts 'as one'. An organisation can be both formal (i.e. created by law or decree) or informal.
- Promise: A promise is a communicated attitude about some future action or state
- Proposition: A (non logical) proposition is a proposition qualified by a propositional attitude. NB: The proposition used here does not correspond to a proposition in proposition logics.
- Propositional_Attitude: A propositional attitude connects a person (the holder of the attitude) to some proposition, in fact it expresses some qualification over the proposition. Distinguishing a proposition from the propositional content expressed by it is necessary when properties relating to the thing expressed and properties of the expression itself must be distinguished. For LKIF the distinction between Belief, Intention, Qualification, and Observation is relevant. The distinction between belief/expectation, intention, and observation is relevant for i.a. establishing mens rea (guilty mind). The distinction between beliefs (expressing the content of the mind of an agent) and statements (expressing the content of an act of communication by an agent) is classical.
- Qualification: A qualification expresses e.g. a judgment. The thing qualified by the qualification is comparable to something else.
- Qualified
- Role: A role is a specification of default behavior and accompanying expectations of the thing 'playing' the role. Similar to actors in a theater who play roles, but are not the roles. Example: student.

Classes:
- Activity: An activity is a generic term for work that company
         performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic (compound). The types
	 of activities that are a part of a Process Model are: Process, 
	 Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are rounded rectangles. 
	 Processes are either unbounded or a contained within a Pool.
- Annotation: Text Annotations are a mechanism for a modeler to
	(attached with an provide additional information for the reader of a 
	Association) BPMN Diagram.
- Business Process Diagram: Gather the set of attributes of a 
	Business Process Diagram
- Compensation Event Detail
- Expression: Expression, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Start Event, Intermediate Event, Activity, Complex 
	Gateway, and Sequence Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN 
	Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Lane: A Lane is a sub-partition within a Pool and will extend 
	the entire length of the Pool, either vertically or horizontally. Lanes 
	are used to organize and categorize activities.
- Message: Message, which is used in the definition of attributes
	for a Start Event, End Event, Intermediate Event, Task, and Message 
	Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see 
	Table B.2)
- Multi Instance Loop Activity: An activity is a generic term 
	for work that company performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic
	(compound). The types of activities that are a part of a Process Model 
	are: Process, Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are 
	rounded rectangles. Processes are either unbounded or a contained 
	within a Pool.
- Pool: A Pool represents a Participant in a Process. It is
                      also acts as a ""swimlane"" and a graphical container
                      for partitioning a set of activities from other Pools,
                      usually in the context of B2B situations.
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.
- Property: Property, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Process and common activity attributes, and which
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Receive Task

- juxtaglomerular apparatus: An anatomical structure which consists of juxtaglomerular cells, extraglomerular mesangial cells and the macula densa. The juxtaglomerular apparatus lies adjacent to the glomerulus and regulates kidney function by maintaining the blood flow to the kidney and the filtration rate[GO]. a microscopic structure in the kidney, which regulates the function of each nephron. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is named for its proximity to the glomerulus: it is found between the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle and the returning distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron. This location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. The three cellular components of the apparatus are the macula densa, extraglomerular mesangial cells, and juxtaglomerular cells (also known as granular cells)[WP].

Classes:
- biological_process: A biological process is the execution of a genetically-encoded biological module or program. It consists of all the steps required to achieve the specific biological objective of the module. A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence.
- disease: A disposition (i) to undergo pathological processes that (ii) exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism.
- economic process: Any process involving the economy, economics, or finances.
- environmental system process: A process in which includes the components of an environmental system as participants.
- history
- material entity
- mathematical process: Any series of calculations performed by mathematical methods.
- molecular_function: A molecular process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine, usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities. Function in this sense denotes an action, or activity, that a gene product (or a complex) performs.

	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would

Classes:
- c d o deal: An Issue of a set of CDO tranches as part of an offering to the market.
- c d o origination objective: The origin or motivation behind a CDO issue.
- cash c d o: A CDO which has an uderlying portfolio of assets which are held by the issuer.
- cash c d o tranche
- collateralized debt obligation: structured finance constructed from a portfolio of fixed income assets including corporate loans and mortgage backed securities. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) issues notes to investors in order to raise funds that are invested in a portfolio of those fixed income assets, held by the SPV as collateral for the notes. Further notes: Collateralized Debt Obligation, for example, ABS CDO which consists of a portfolio of different ABS bonds, and the payments to the holders of these trust certificates are derived from the cash flows of the ABS bonds. This CDO instrument is part of a CDO issue, consisting of individual CDO instruments of a given seniority. Often referred to as tranches and slices (Investopedia). Investopedia: Similar in structure to a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO), CDOs are unique in that they represent different types of debt and credit risk. In the case of CDOs, these different types of debt are often referred to as 'tranches' or 'slices'. Each slice has a different maturity and risk associated with it. The higher the risk, the more the CDO pays. Further details: Collateralized Debt obligations are securitized interests in pools of - generally non-mortgage - assets. Assets - called collateral - usually comprise loans or debt instruments. A CDO may be called a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO) if it holds only loans or bonds, respectively. Investors bear the credit risk of the collateral. Multiple tranches of securities are issued by the CDO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics.
- floater tranche: A floater tranche is a tranche that is keyed to an index and a spread.
- m b s tranche note: An individual note of a tranche.

Classes:
- Complex Work: Works that have other works as members. The members of a Complex Work may constitute alternatives to or derivatives of other members of the same Complex Work. Typically the members of the complex work represent the successive temporal versions of an act, while the complex work represents the act independantly of one of its version.
- Concept
- Expression: The intellectual realisation of a Work in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as, but not limited to, text.

The substance of Expression is signs.

An Expression cannot exist without a physical carrier but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
- F1_Work
- F22_Self-Contained_Expression
- F3_Manifestation_Product_Type
- Format: The physical embodiment of a legal expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.
For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Language: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/language
- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.
- Version: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:VersionTable
- Work: Any distinct intellectual creation (i.e., the intellectual content), in the context of ELI.

The substance of Work is ideas.
- Work Subdivision: A component of a work, at an arbitrary level of precision. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.

Classes:
- Activity: An activity is a generic term for work that company
         performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic (compound). The types
	 of activities that are a part of a Process Model are: Process, 
	 Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are rounded rectangles. 
	 Processes are either unbounded or a contained within a Pool.
- Annotation: Text Annotations are a mechanism for a modeler to
	(attached with an provide additional information for the reader of a 
	Association) BPMN Diagram.
- Artifact: Artifacts are used to provide additional information 
	about the Process. There are three standardized Artifacts, but modelers
	or modeling tools are free to add as many Artifacts as required. There 
	may be addition BPMN efforts to standardize a larger set of Artifacts 
	for general use or for vertical markets. The current set of Artifacts 
	include: Data Object, Group, Annotation
- ArtifactOutput: artifact_output, which is used in the 
	definition of attributes for all graphical elements.
- BPMN element: Base element
- Category: Category, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for all BPMN elements, and which extends the set of common 
	BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2). Since a Category is also a 
	BPMN element, a Category can have Categories to create a hierarchical 
	structure of Categories.
- Expression: Expression, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Start Event, Intermediate Event, Activity, Complex 
	Gateway, and Sequence Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN 
	Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Output Set: OutputSet, which is used in the definition of 
	common attributes for Activities and for attributes of a Process, and 
	which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes 
	(see Table B.2).
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would

- Agent: An agent is any owl:Thing which can act, i.e. play the 'actor' role wrt. an action
- Assertion: The assertion is subject to a fit between words and world, in Searle's terms. It's propositional content can be true of false. If it is inconsistent with other assertions, beliefs, observations, it may come to be considered false.
- Belief: Someting an agent 'believes in', i.e. holds as true
- Communicated_Attitude: A communictated attitude is a propositional attitude involved in an act of communication.
- Disallowed_Intention: The propositional content (i.e. that which is intended) of the intention is disallowed. Interesting concept for establishing mens rea (guilty mind), although 'disallowed' is a weaker qualification than criminal. Note the distinction between purposely committing a crime and knowingly committing a crime. The crime committed does not have to match the crime intended for establishing intent!
- Evaluative_Attitude: An evaluative attitude expresses e.g. a judgment. The proposition qualified by the evaluative attitude is comparable to something else.
- Evaluative_Proposition: Some thing which is evaluatively qualified, i.e. an evaluation applies to the proposition, the proposition is judged. The proposition is comparable to some other proposition.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Intention: Intention is where the agent expects certain consequences of his or her actions and desires those consequences to occur. This concept must be related to qualification and preference in some way.
- Organisation: An organisation is a group of other organisations or persons which acts 'as one'. An organisation can be both formal (i.e. created by law or decree) or informal.
- Person: A person is an individual agent. Usually associated with 'human being'.
- Propositional_Attitude: A propositional attitude connects a person (the holder of the attitude) to some proposition, in fact it expresses some qualification over the proposition. Distinguishing a proposition from the propositional content expressed by it is necessary when properties relating to the thing expressed and properties of the expression itself must be distinguished. For LKIF the distinction between Belief, Intention, Qualification, and Observation is relevant. The distinction between belief/expectation, intention, and observation is relevant for i.a. establishing mens rea (guilty mind). The distinction between beliefs (expressing the content of the mind of an agent) and statements (expressing the content of an act of communication by an agent) is classical.
- Qualification: A qualification expresses e.g. a judgment. The thing qualified by the qualification is comparable to something else.
- Qualified
- Role: A role is a specification of default behavior and accompanying expectations of the thing 'playing' the role. Similar to actors in a theater who play roles, but are not the roles. Example: student.

- Complex Work: Works that have other works as members. The members of a Complex Work may constitute alternatives to or derivatives of other members of the same Complex Work. Typically the members of the complex work represent the successive temporal versions of an act, while the complex work represents the act independantly of one of its version.
- Concept
- Expression: The intellectual realisation of a Work in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as, but not limited to, text.

The substance of Expression is signs.

An Expression cannot exist without a physical carrier but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
- F1_Work
- F22_Self-Contained_Expression
- Format: The physical embodiment of a legal expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.
For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.
- Subdivision type: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:SubdivisionTypeTable

- G-protein coupled receptor: A protein that has G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity. Each GPCR consists of a single polypeptide with an extracellular N-terminus, an intracellular C-terminus and seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM1-TM7) linked by three extracellular loops (ECL1-ECL3) and three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3). GPCRs function as part of a heterotrimeric complex to transmit an extracellular signal across the membrane by activating an associated G-protein via the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha subunit.
- cellular_component: A location, relative to cellular compartments and structures, occupied by a macromolecular machine. There are three types of cellular components described in the gene ontology: (1) the cellular anatomical entity where a gene product carries out a molecular function (e.g., plasma membrane, cytoskeleton) or membrane-enclosed compartments (e.g., mitochondrion); (2) virion components, where viral proteins act, and (3) the stable macromolecular complexes of which gene product are parts (e.g., the clathrin complex).

Classes:
- Artifact: Artifacts are used to provide additional information 
	about the Process. There are three standardized Artifacts, but modelers
	or modeling tools are free to add as many Artifacts as required. There 
	may be addition BPMN efforts to standardize a larger set of Artifacts 
	for general use or for vertical markets. The current set of Artifacts 
	include: Data Object, Group, Annotation
- ArtifactInput: artifact_input, which is used in the definition
	of attributes for all graphical elements.
- Category: Category, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for all BPMN elements, and which extends the set of common 
	BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2). Since a Category is also a 
	BPMN element, a Category can have Categories to create a hierarchical 
	structure of Categories.
- Gate: Gate, which is used in the definition of attributes for 
	Gateways, and which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes 
	(see Table B.2).
- Gateway: A Gateway is used to control the divergence and 
	convergence of Sequence Flow. Thus, it will determine branching, 
	forking, merging, and joining of paths. Internal Markers will indicate
	the type of behavior control.
- Graphical element: These are the elements that define the 
	basic look-and-feel of BPMN. Most business processes will be modeled 
	adequately with these elements
- Group: A grouping of activities that does not affect the 
	Sequence Flow. The grouping can be used for documentation or analysis 
	purposes. Groups can also be used to identify the activities of a
	distributed transaction that is shown across Pools.
- Input Set: InputSet, which is used in the definition of common
	attributes for Activities and for attributes of a Process, and which 
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Object: Object, which is used in the definition of attributes 
	for all graphical elements.
- Participant: Participant, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Pool, Message, and Web service, and which extends the 
	set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.
- Property: Property, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Process and common activity attributes, and which
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Reusable Sub-process
- Sequence Flow: A Sequence Flow is used to show the order that
              activities will be performed in a Process.
- Standard Loop Activity: An activity is a generic term for work 
	that company performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic 
	(compound). The types of activities that are a part of a Process Model 
	are: Process, Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are rounded
	rectangles. Processes are either unbounded or a contained within a 
	Pool.

- Complex Work: Works that have other works as members. The members of a Complex Work may constitute alternatives to or derivatives of other members of the same Complex Work. Typically the members of the complex work represent the successive temporal versions of an act, while the complex work represents the act independantly of one of its version.
- Concept
- E39_Actor
- Expression: The intellectual realisation of a Work in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as, but not limited to, text.

The substance of Expression is signs.

An Expression cannot exist without a physical carrier but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
- F1_Work
- F22_Self-Contained_Expression
- Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:WorkTypeTable
- Format: The physical embodiment of a legal expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.
For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.

Classes:
- Activity: An activity is a generic term for work that company
         performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic (compound). The types
	 of activities that are a part of a Process Model are: Process, 
	 Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are rounded rectangles. 
	 Processes are either unbounded or a contained within a Pool.
- Business Process Diagram: Gather the set of attributes of a 
	Business Process Diagram
- Data Object: Data Objects are considered Artifacts because they
	do not have any direct effect on the Sequence Flow or Message Flow of 
	the Process, but they do provide information about what activities 
	require to be performed and/or what they produce.
- Multi Instance Loop Activity: An activity is a generic term 
	for work that company performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic
	(compound). The types of activities that are a part of a Process Model 
	are: Process, Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are 
	rounded rectangles. Processes are either unbounded or a contained 
	within a Pool.
- Participant: Participant, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Pool, Message, and Web service, and which extends the 
	set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Pool: A Pool represents a Participant in a Process. It is
                      also acts as a ""swimlane"" and a graphical container
                      for partitioning a set of activities from other Pools,
                      usually in the context of B2B situations.
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.
- Property: Property, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Process and common activity attributes, and which
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Reusable Sub-process
- Transaction: Transaction, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Sub-Process, and which extends the set of common BPMN 
	Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Web Service: Web Service, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Message Start Event, Message Intermediate Event, Message 
	End Event, Receive Task, Send Task, Service Task, and User Task, and 
	which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes
	(see Table B.2).

Classes:
- CHEBI_24431
- G-protein coupled receptor: A protein that has G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity. Each GPCR consists of a single polypeptide with an extracellular N-terminus, an intracellular C-terminus and seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM1-TM7) linked by three extracellular loops (ECL1-ECL3) and three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3). GPCRs function as part of a heterotrimeric complex to transmit an extracellular signal across the membrane by activating an associated G-protein via the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha subunit.
- cellular_component: A location, relative to cellular compartments and structures, occupied by a macromolecular machine. There are three types of cellular components described in the gene ontology: (1) the cellular anatomical entity where a gene product carries out a molecular function (e.g., plasma membrane, cytoskeleton) or membrane-enclosed compartments (e.g., mitochondrion); (2) virion components, where viral proteins act, and (3) the stable macromolecular complexes of which gene product are parts (e.g., the clathrin complex).
- channel protein: A protein that has channel activity. Channel proteins enable energy-independent facilitated diffusion, mediated by passage of a solute through a transmembrane aqueous pore or channel.
- continuant

- fund subscription terms: Subscription terms for the fund. Further notes: ISO FIBIM, EFAMA DD and FPP combine terms for subscription, redemption and general holding requirements. These have been separated here as they are different kinds of term, but this can be reviewed. Subscription Terms are identified as terms of the fund and not the fund unit, since terms for how you might subscribe can't be binding one someone who has not yet subscribed.

Classes:
- Association: An Association is used to associate information
            with Flow Objects. Text and graphical non-Flow
            Objects can be associated with the Flow Objects.
- Business Process Diagram: Gather the set of attributes of a 
	Business Process Diagram
- Embedded Sub-process
- Lane: A Lane is a sub-partition within a Pool and will extend 
	the entire length of the Pool, either vertically or horizontally. Lanes 
	are used to organize and categorize activities.
- Multi Instance Loop Activity: An activity is a generic term 
	for work that company performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic
	(compound). The types of activities that are a part of a Process Model 
	are: Process, Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are 
	rounded rectangles. Processes are either unbounded or a contained 
	within a Pool.
- Participant: Participant, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Pool, Message, and Web service, and which extends the 
	set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.

Classes:
- Activity: An activity is a generic term for work that company
         performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic (compound). The types
	 of activities that are a part of a Process Model are: Process, 
	 Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are rounded rectangles. 
	 Processes are either unbounded or a contained within a Pool.
- Connecting object: There are three ways of connecting the Flow 
	Objects to each other or other information. There are three Connecting
	Objects: Sequence Flow, Message Flow, and Association
- Data Object: Data Objects are considered Artifacts because they
	do not have any direct effect on the Sequence Flow or Message Flow of 
	the Process, but they do provide information about what activities 
	require to be performed and/or what they produce.
- Graphical element: These are the elements that define the 
	basic look-and-feel of BPMN. Most business processes will be modeled 
	adequately with these elements
- Input Set: InputSet, which is used in the definition of common
	attributes for Activities and for attributes of a Process, and which 
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Intermediate: Intermediate Events occur between a Start
                    Event and an End Event. It will affect the
		    flow of the process, but will not start or
		    (directly) terminate the process.
- Output Set: OutputSet, which is used in the definition of 
	common attributes for Activities and for attributes of a Process, and 
	which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes 
	(see Table B.2).
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.

	attributes for a Process and common activity attributes, and which
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).

- Sub-process: A Sub-Process is a compound activity
	               that is included within a Process. It is
                       compound in that it can be broken down

Classes:
- Action: An action is a change which is brought about by a single agent, playing a role. The agent is the holder of some indended outcome of the action: an action is always intentional. The intention of the agent has usually corresponds with an expectation the intended outcome to be brought about: the agent believes in some expectation. Note that the intention might not correspond with the *actual* outcome of the action.
- Agent: An agent is any owl:Thing which can act, i.e. play the 'actor' role wrt. an action
- Creation: An act which results in the creation of some entity/individual
- Declaration: Searle: the successful performance of a declaration is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true. In other words, if there is an inconsistency between the declaration and assertions, beliefs, or observations, it is not the declaration that is false. True of definitions and norms, and several other performative statements by legislators.
- Evaluative_Attitude: An evaluative attitude expresses e.g. a judgment. The proposition qualified by the evaluative attitude is comparable to something else.
- Evaluative_Proposition: Some thing which is evaluatively qualified, i.e. an evaluation applies to the proposition, the proposition is judged. The proposition is comparable to some other proposition.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Medium: A medium is a bearer of expressions, i.e. externalised propositions. Propositions become expressions once they are externalised through some medium.
- Mental_Entity: We made the assumption that our views of the mental world have been developed in analogy with physical processes. Mental objects like thoughts are made of elementary parts: concepts. The contents (substance) of these objects are representations. The conceptual content of thoughts are intended by propositional attitudes, like belief, desire, norm etc. Mental objects are processed or stored in containers like a mind which has parts like various memories. Mental processes like thinking, memorizing, imaging, etc. are operations on mental objects. The energy equivalent of mental processing are emotions: the forces that make us focus our mental energies. 

There is an important difference between the mental world and the physical. Where physical processes occur causally, mental processes are controlled by an intentional stance. The outcome of mental processes can be the intention to act. The intention to act may consist of a structure of primary actions: a plan. The actions can be aimed at bringing about physical changes, but they may also be aimed at changing the mental state of another agent: these intended actions are communication actions. Like direct actions, communication actions have a physical appearance. They also need some physical medium to transfer the intended mental state. Speech act is the common term for these actions. 

Whether this notion of intended control over mental processes and actions is an illusion or not is besides the point in modeling common-sense. The intentional stance implies a kind of backward, teleological reasoning over causally related processes. A mental object like a  plan consists of a goal state (intention) and is produced by reasoning from goal to means (actions): this is what rational agency behavior is about. 

The mental world is not only a reflective one based in our minds eye. We may observe the stream of conscious mental processes, but the role of the mental conceptualizations is of even more important in understanding and communicating with other people. Mental processes and attitudes (sources of intention) are in the first place the building stones for modeling the minds of other people. The intentional stance means in the first place that we attribute to others and to some extent also to many animals intentions and intention directed mental processing and belief.
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Process: A process is a 'causal' change: any change which can be explained through some known or understood causal structure. Every process has some Time_Period as duration.

Classes:
- Artifact: Artifacts are used to provide additional information 
	about the Process. There are three standardized Artifacts, but modelers
	or modeling tools are free to add as many Artifacts as required. There 
	may be addition BPMN efforts to standardize a larger set of Artifacts 
	for general use or for vertical markets. The current set of Artifacts 
	include: Data Object, Group, Annotation
- Assignment: Assignment, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Process, Activities, Events, Gateways, and Gates, and 
	which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes
- Event Detail: present the attributes common to all Event 
	Details and the specific attributes for the Event Details that have 
	additional attributes. Note that the Cancel and Terminate Event Details
	do not have additional attributes
- Expression: Expression, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Start Event, Intermediate Event, Activity, Complex 
	Gateway, and Sequence Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN 
	Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Graphical element: These are the elements that define the 
	basic look-and-feel of BPMN. Most business processes will be modeled 
	adequately with these elements
- Multi Instance Loop Activity: An activity is a generic term 
	for work that company performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic
	(compound). The types of activities that are a part of a Process Model 
	are: Process, Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are 
	rounded rectangles. Processes are either unbounded or a contained 
	within a Pool.
- Object: Object, which is used in the definition of attributes 
	for all graphical elements.
- Participant: Participant, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Pool, Message, and Web service, and which extends the 
	set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.
- Property: Property, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Process and common activity attributes, and which
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Reference Sub-process
- Sequence Flow: A Sequence Flow is used to show the order that
              activities will be performed in a Process.
- Sub-process: A Sub-Process is a compound activity
	               that is included within a Process. It is
                       compound in that it can be broken down
                       into a finer level of detail (a Process)
                       through a set of sub-activities.

Classes:
- Artifact: Artifacts are used to provide additional information 
	about the Process. There are three standardized Artifacts, but modelers
	or modeling tools are free to add as many Artifacts as required. There 
	may be addition BPMN efforts to standardize a larger set of Artifacts 
	for general use or for vertical markets. The current set of Artifacts 
	include: Data Object, Group, Annotation
- ArtifactInput: artifact_input, which is used in the definition
	of attributes for all graphical elements.
- ArtifactOutput: artifact_output, which is used in the 
	definition of attributes for all graphical elements.
- Assignment: Assignment, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Process, Activities, Events, Gateways, and Gates, and 
	which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes
- Connecting object: There are three ways of connecting the Flow 
	Objects to each other or other information. There are three Connecting
	Objects: Sequence Flow, Message Flow, and Association
- Expression: Expression, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Start Event, Intermediate Event, Activity, Complex 
	Gateway, and Sequence Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN 
	Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Gate: Gate, which is used in the definition of attributes for 
	Gateways, and which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes 
	(see Table B.2).
- Graphical element: These are the elements that define the 
	basic look-and-feel of BPMN. Most business processes will be modeled 
	adequately with these elements
- Group: A grouping of activities that does not affect the 
	Sequence Flow. The grouping can be used for documentation or analysis 
	purposes. Groups can also be used to identify the activities of a
	distributed transaction that is shown across Pools.
- Input Set: InputSet, which is used in the definition of common
	attributes for Activities and for attributes of a Process, and which 
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Output Set: OutputSet, which is used in the definition of 
	common attributes for Activities and for attributes of a Process, and 
	which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes 
	(see Table B.2).
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.
- Sequence Flow: A Sequence Flow is used to show the order that
              activities will be performed in a Process.
- Sub-process: A Sub-Process is a compound activity
	               that is included within a Process. It is
                       compound in that it can be broken down
                       into a finer level of detail (a Process)
                       through a set of sub-activities.

Classes:
- Complex Work: Works that have other works as members. The members of a Complex Work may constitute alternatives to or derivatives of other members of the same Complex Work. Typically the members of the complex work represent the successive temporal versions of an act, while the complex work represents the act independantly of one of its version.
- Expression: The intellectual realisation of a Work in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as, but not limited to, text.

The substance of Expression is signs.

An Expression cannot exist without a physical carrier but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
- F1_Work
- F22_Self-Contained_Expression
- F3_Manifestation_Product_Type
- Format: The physical embodiment of a legal expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.
For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.
- Work: Any distinct intellectual creation (i.e., the intellectual content), in the context of ELI.

The substance of Work is ideas.

	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.

- Sequence Flow: A Sequence Flow is used to show the order that
              activities will be performed in a Process.
- Task [Atomic]: A Task is an atomic activity that is included within a

Classes:
- Absolute_Place: An absolute place is defined without reference to other places.
- Comprehensive_Place: A place is comprehensive if it always covers every place (and thus also every location-complex) and every object.
- Location_Complex: A location complex is a relatively stable complex of places referred to as one: it is the maximal collection of places with the same reference object.
- Occurrence: A consequence of our clear separation of ontology from models of situations (occurrences), is well exemplified in the two ways we look at time and space. Things happen against the canvas of space and time. This 3D canvas moving in time (or whatever metaphor) allows us to index instances of objects and processes. Time and space provide positions in time and space for objects. Positions are in general modeled in some mereological framework. However, the objects and processes as classes have time and space properties in a different way. Space occupied by an object is its inherent property of size or extension. This property was for Descartes even the critical one that separated mental (not: abstract) objects from physical ones. Processes occupy (consume) time; they take some duration. This time resource is inversely related to the consumption of energy. This distinction between position and extension is also made in various other ontologies. However, this distinction is easily obscured by the fact that the extension of an object can also be used as a reference for location. An object can be in another object. In fact, any physical object can be used as a spatial and even temporal referent. This does not refute our view that locations are occurrences. To be precise: extension is an inherent, necessary property of a physical object or process; its location is an accidental one.

For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource.

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.
- Resource type: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:ResourceTypeTable
- Work: Any distinct intellectual creation (i.e., the intellectual content), in the context of ELI.

The substance of Work is ideas.
- Work Subdivision: A component of a work, at an arbitrary level of precision. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.

- E39_Actor
- Expression: The intellectual realisation of a Work in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as, but not limited to, text.

The substance of Expression is signs.

An Expression cannot exist without a physical carrier but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
- F1_Work
- F22_Self-Contained_Expression
- F3_Manifestation_Product_Type
- Format: The physical embodiment of a legal expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.
For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.
- Organization: Institutions or groups of people that have obtained a legal recognition as a group and can act collectively as agents.
- Person: A real person who live or has lived.
- Work: Any distinct intellectual creation (i.e., the intellectual content), in the context of ELI.

Classes:
- Agent: An agent is any owl:Thing which can act, i.e. play the 'actor' role wrt. an action
- Assertion: The assertion is subject to a fit between words and world, in Searle's terms. It's propositional content can be true of false. If it is inconsistent with other assertions, beliefs, observations, it may come to be considered false.
- Belief: Someting an agent 'believes in', i.e. holds as true
- Communicated_Attitude: A communictated attitude is a propositional attitude involved in an act of communication.
- Declaration: Searle: the successful performance of a declaration is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true. In other words, if there is an inconsistency between the declaration and assertions, beliefs, or observations, it is not the declaration that is false. True of definitions and norms, and several other performative statements by legislators.
- Desire: A feeling of wanting
- Evaluative_Attitude: An evaluative attitude expresses e.g. a judgment. The proposition qualified by the evaluative attitude is comparable to something else.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Intention: Intention is where the agent expects certain consequences of his or her actions and desires those consequences to occur. This concept must be related to qualification and preference in some way.
- Medium: A medium is a bearer of expressions, i.e. externalised propositions. Propositions become expressions once they are externalised through some medium.
- Mental_Entity: We made the assumption that our views of the mental world have been developed in analogy with physical processes. Mental objects like thoughts are made of elementary parts: concepts. The contents (substance) of these objects are representations. The conceptual content of thoughts are intended by propositional attitudes, like belief, desire, norm etc. Mental objects are processed or stored in containers like a mind which has parts like various memories. Mental processes like thinking, memorizing, imaging, etc. are operations on mental objects. The energy equivalent of mental processing are emotions: the forces that make us focus our mental energies. 

There is an important difference between the mental world and the physical. Where physical processes occur causally, mental processes are controlled by an intentional stance. The outcome of mental processes can be the intention to act. The intention to act may consist of a structure of primary actions: a plan. The actions can be aimed at bringing about physical changes, but they may also be aimed at changing the mental state of another agent: these intended actions are communication actions. Like direct actions, communication actions have a physical appearance. They also need some physical medium to transfer the intended mental state. Speech act is the common term for these actions. 

Whether this notion of intended control over mental processes and actions is an illusion or not is besides the point in modeling common-sense. The intentional stance implies a kind of backward, teleological reasoning over causally related processes. A mental object like a  plan consists of a goal state (intention) and is produced by reasoning from goal to means (actions): this is what rational agency behavior is about. 

The mental world is not only a reflective one based in our minds eye. We may observe the stream of conscious mental processes, but the role of the mental conceptualizations is of even more important in understanding and communicating with other people. Mental processes and attitudes (sources of intention) are in the first place the building stones for modeling the minds of other people. The intentional stance means in the first place that we attribute to others and to some extent also to many animals intentions and intention directed mental processing and belief.
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Proposition: A (non logical) proposition is a proposition qualified by a propositional attitude. NB: The proposition used here does not correspond to a proposition in proposition logics.
- Propositional_Attitude: A propositional attitude connects a person (the holder of the attitude) to some proposition, in fact it expresses some qualification over the proposition. Distinguishing a proposition from the propositional content expressed by it is necessary when properties relating to the thing expressed and properties of the expression itself must be distinguished. For LKIF the distinction between Belief, Intention, Qualification, and Observation is relevant. The distinction between belief/expectation, intention, and observation is relevant for i.a. establishing mens rea (guilty mind). The distinction between beliefs (expressing the content of the mind of an agent) and statements (expressing the content of an act of communication by an agent) is classical.
- Role: A role is a specification of default behavior and accompanying expectations of the thing 'playing' the role. Similar to actors in a theater who play roles, but are not the roles. Example: student.

Classes:
- CHEBI_24431
- G-protein coupled receptor: A protein that has G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity. Each GPCR consists of a single polypeptide with an extracellular N-terminus, an intracellular C-terminus and seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM1-TM7) linked by three extracellular loops (ECL1-ECL3) and three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3). GPCRs function as part of a heterotrimeric complex to transmit an extracellular signal across the membrane by activating an associated G-protein via the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha subunit.
- cellular_component: A location, relative to cellular compartments and structures, occupied by a macromolecular machine. There are three types of cellular components described in the gene ontology: (1) the cellular anatomical entity where a gene product carries out a molecular function (e.g., plasma membrane, cytoskeleton) or membrane-enclosed compartments (e.g., mitochondrion); (2) virion components, where viral proteins act, and (3) the stable macromolecular complexes of which gene product are parts (e.g., the clathrin complex).

- Complex Work: Works that have other works as members. The members of a Complex Work may constitute alternatives to or derivatives of other members of the same Complex Work. Typically the members of the complex work represent the successive temporal versions of an act, while the complex work represents the act independantly of one of its version.
- Concept
- Expression: The intellectual realisation of a Work in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as, but not limited to, text.

For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Format type: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:MediaTypeTable.
- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

- Concept
- Format type: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:MediaTypeTable.
- Impiego: A Post represents some position within an organization that exists independently of the person or persons filling it. Posts may be used to represent situations where a person is a member of an organization ex officio (for example the Secretary of State for Scotland is part of UK Cabinet by virtue of being Secretary of State for Scotland, not as an individual person). A post can be held by multiple people and hence can be treated as a organization in its own right.

- Organization
- Organization
- OrganizationalUnit: An Organization such as a University Support Unit which is part of some larger FormalOrganization and only has full recognition within the context of that FormalOrganization, it is not a Legal Entity in its own right. Units can be large and complex containing other Units and even FormalOrganizations. Alternative names: _OU_ _Unit_ _Department_
- Partenariat: A collaboration between two or more Organizations such as a project. It meets the criteria for being an Organization in that it has an identity and defining purpose independent of its particular members but is neither a formally recognized legal entity nor a sub-unit within some larger organization. Might typically have a shorter lifetime than the Organizations within it, but not necessarily. All members are `org:Organization`s rather than individuals and those Organizations can play particular roles within the venture. Alternative names: _Project_ _Venture_  _Endeavour_ _Consortium_ _Endeavour_
- Person
- Rôle: Denotes a role that a Person or other Agent can take in an organization. Instances of this class describe the abstract role; to denote a specific instance of a person playing that role in a specific organization use an instance of `org:Membership`. It is common for roles to be arranged in some taxonomic structure and we use SKOS to represent that. The normal SKOS lexical properties should be used when labelling the Role. Additional descriptive properties for the Role, such as a Salary band, may be added by extension vocabularies.
- Sede: An office or other premise at which the organization is located. Many organizations are spread across multiple sites and many sites will host multiple locations. In most cases a Site will be a physical location. However, we don't exclude the possibility of non-physical sites such as a virtual office with an associated post box and phone reception service. Extensions may provide subclasses to denote particular types of site.
- organización formal: An Organization which is recognized in the world at large, in particular in legal jurisdictions, with associated rights and responsibilities. Examples include a Corporation, Charity, Government or Church. Note that this is a super class of `gr:BusinessEntity` and it is recommended to use the GoodRelations vocabulary to denote Business classifications such as DUNS or NAICS.

The juxtaglomerular apparatus lies adjacent to the glomerulus and regulates kidney function by maintaining the blood flow to the kidney and the filtration rate[GO]. a microscopic structure in the kidney, which regulates the function of each nephron. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is named for its proximity to the glomerulus: it is found between the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle and the returning distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron. This location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. The three cellular components of the apparatus are the macula densa, extraglomerular mesangial cells, and juxtaglomerular cells (also known as granular cells)[WP].

Classes:
- Absolute_Place: An absolute place is defined without reference to other places.
- Comprehensive_Place: A place is comprehensive if it always covers every place (and thus also every location-complex) and every object.
- Location_Complex: A location complex is a relatively stable complex of places referred to as one: it is the maximal collection of places with the same reference object.
- Occurrence: A consequence of our clear separation of ontology from models of situations (occurrences), is well exemplified in the two ways we look at time and space. Things happen against the canvas of space and time. This 3D canvas moving in time (or whatever metaphor) allows us to index instances of objects and processes. Time and space provide positions in time and space for objects. Positions are in general modeled in some mereological framework. However, the objects and processes as classes have time and space properties in a different way. Space occupied by an object is its inherent property of size or extension. This property was for Descartes even the critical one that separated mental (not: abstract) objects from physical ones. Processes occupy (consume) time; they take some duration. This time resource is inversely related to the consumption of energy. This distinction between position and extension is also made in various other ontologies. However, this distinction is easily obscured by the fact that the extension of an object can also be used as a reference for location. An object can be in another object. In fact, any physical object can be used as a spatial and even temporal referent. This does not refute our view that locations are occurrences. To be precise: extension is an inherent, necessary property of a physical object or process; its location is an accidental one.

Classes:
- Agent: An agent is any owl:Thing which can act, i.e. play the 'actor' role wrt. an action
- Assertion: The assertion is subject to a fit between words and world, in Searle's terms. It's propositional content can be true of false. If it is inconsistent with other assertions, beliefs, observations, it may come to be considered false.
- Belief: Someting an agent 'believes in', i.e. holds as true
- Communicated_Attitude: A communictated attitude is a propositional attitude involved in an act of communication.
- Evaluative_Attitude: An evaluative attitude expresses e.g. a judgment. The proposition qualified by the evaluative attitude is comparable to something else.
- Evaluative_Proposition: Some thing which is evaluatively qualified, i.e. an evaluation applies to the proposition, the proposition is judged. The proposition is comparable to some other proposition.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Intention: Intention is where the agent expects certain consequences of his or her actions and desires those consequences to occur. This concept must be related to qualification and preference in some way.
- Mental_Entity: We made the assumption that our views of the mental world have been developed in analogy with physical processes. Mental objects like thoughts are made of elementary parts: concepts. The contents (substance) of these objects are representations. The conceptual content of thoughts are intended by propositional attitudes, like belief, desire, norm etc. Mental objects are processed or stored in containers like a mind which has parts like various memories. Mental processes like thinking, memorizing, imaging, etc. are operations on mental objects. The energy equivalent of mental processing are emotions: the forces that make us focus our mental energies. 

There is an important difference between the mental world and the physical. Where physical processes occur causally, mental processes are controlled by an intentional stance. The outcome of mental processes can be the intention to act. The intention to act may consist of a structure of primary actions: a plan. The actions can be aimed at bringing about physical changes, but they may also be aimed at changing the mental state of another agent: these intended actions are communication actions. Like direct actions, communication actions have a physical appearance. They also need some physical medium to transfer the intended mental state. Speech act is the common term for these actions. 

Whether this notion of intended control over mental processes and actions is an illusion or not is besides the point in modeling common-sense. The intentional stance implies a kind of backward, teleological reasoning over causally related processes. A mental object like a  plan consists of a goal state (intention) and is produced by reasoning from goal to means (actions): this is what rational agency behavior is about. 

The mental world is not only a reflective one based in our minds eye. We may observe the stream of conscious mental processes, but the role of the mental conceptualizations is of even more important in understanding and communicating with other people. Mental processes and attitudes (sources of intention) are in the first place the building stones for modeling the minds of other people. The intentional stance means in the first place that we attribute to others and to some extent also to many animals intentions and intention directed mental processing and belief.
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Organisation: An organisation is a group of other organisations or persons which acts 'as one'. An organisation can be both formal (i.e. created by law or decree) or informal.
- Plan: A plan is a structure of multiple other plans or actions. These can be both sequential or concurrent. Usually a plan is referred to in the context of the intention to act of some agent, however when executed the plan itself comes into effect.
- Proposition: A (non logical) proposition is a proposition qualified by a propositional attitude. NB: The proposition used here does not correspond to a proposition in proposition logics.
- Propositional_Attitude: A propositional attitude connects a person (the holder of the attitude) to some proposition, in fact it expresses some qualification over the proposition. Distinguishing a proposition from the propositional content expressed by it is necessary when properties relating to the thing expressed and properties of the expression itself must be distinguished. For LKIF the distinction between Belief, Intention, Qualification, and Observation is relevant. The distinction between belief/expectation, intention, and observation is relevant for i.a. establishing mens rea (guilty mind). The distinction between beliefs (expressing the content of the mind of an agent) and statements (expressing the content of an act of communication by an agent) is classical.
- Qualification: A qualification expresses e.g. a judgment. The thing qualified by the qualification is comparable to something else.

- Partenariat: A collaboration between two or more Organizations such as a project. It meets the criteria for being an Organization in that it has an identity and defining purpose independent of its particular members but is neither a formally recognized legal entity nor a sub-unit within some larger organization. Might typically have a shorter lifetime than the Organizations within it, but not necessarily. All members are `org:Organization`s rather than individuals and those Organizations can play particular roles within the venture. Alternative names: _Project_ _Venture_  _Endeavour_ _Consortium_ _Endeavour_
- Rôle: Denotes a role that a Person or other Agent can take in an organization. Instances of this class describe the abstract role; to denote a specific instance of a person playing that role in a specific organization use an instance of `org:Membership`. It is common for roles to be arranged in some taxonomic structure and we use SKOS to represent that. The normal SKOS lexical properties should be used when labelling the Role. Additional descriptive properties for the Role, such as a Salary band, may be added by extension vocabularies.
- Sede: An office or other premise at which the organization is located. Many organizations are spread across multiple sites and many sites will host multiple locations. In most cases a Site will be a physical location. However, we don't exclude the possibility of non-physical sites such as a virtual office with an associated post box and phone reception service. Extensions may provide subclasses to denote particular types of site.
- organización formal: An Organization which is recognized in the world at large, in particular in legal jurisdictions, with associated rights and responsibilities. Examples include a Corporation, Charity, Government or Church. Note that this is a super class of `gr:BusinessEntity` and it is recommended to use the GoodRelations vocabulary to denote Business classifications such as DUNS or NAICS.

	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual

Classes:
- Complex Work: Works that have other works as members. The members of a Complex Work may constitute alternatives to or derivatives of other members of the same Complex Work. Typically the members of the complex work represent the successive temporal versions of an act, while the complex work represents the act independantly of one of its version.
- Concept
- Expression: The intellectual realisation of a Work in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as, but not limited to, text.

The substance of Expression is signs.

An Expression cannot exist without a physical carrier but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
- F1_Work
- F22_Self-Contained_Expression
- F3_Manifestation_Product_Type
- Format: The physical embodiment of a legal expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.
For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Format type: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:MediaTypeTable.
- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Legal value: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:LegalValueTable
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.
- Work: Any distinct intellectual creation (i.e., the intellectual content), in the context of ELI.

The substance of Work is ideas.

Classes:
- Agent: An agent is any owl:Thing which can act, i.e. play the 'actor' role wrt. an action
- Assertion: The assertion is subject to a fit between words and world, in Searle's terms. It's propositional content can be true of false. If it is inconsistent with other assertions, beliefs, observations, it may come to be considered false.
- Belief: Someting an agent 'believes in', i.e. holds as true
- Communicated_Attitude: A communictated attitude is a propositional attitude involved in an act of communication.
- Declaration: Searle: the successful performance of a declaration is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true. In other words, if there is an inconsistency between the declaration and assertions, beliefs, or observations, it is not the declaration that is false. True of definitions and norms, and several other performative statements by legislators.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Intention: Intention is where the agent expects certain consequences of his or her actions and desires those consequences to occur. This concept must be related to qualification and preference in some way.
- Medium: A medium is a bearer of expressions, i.e. externalised propositions. Propositions become expressions once they are externalised through some medium.
- Mental_Entity: We made the assumption that our views of the mental world have been developed in analogy with physical processes. Mental objects like thoughts are made of elementary parts: concepts. The contents (substance) of these objects are representations. The conceptual content of thoughts are intended by propositional attitudes, like belief, desire, norm etc. Mental objects are processed or stored in containers like a mind which has parts like various memories. Mental processes like thinking, memorizing, imaging, etc. are operations on mental objects. The energy equivalent of mental processing are emotions: the forces that make us focus our mental energies. 

There is an important difference between the mental world and the physical. Where physical processes occur causally, mental processes are controlled by an intentional stance. The outcome of mental processes can be the intention to act. The intention to act may consist of a structure of primary actions: a plan. The actions can be aimed at bringing about physical changes, but they may also be aimed at changing the mental state of another agent: these intended actions are communication actions. Like direct actions, communication actions have a physical appearance. They also need some physical medium to transfer the intended mental state. Speech act is the common term for these actions. 

Whether this notion of intended control over mental processes and actions is an illusion or not is besides the point in modeling common-sense. The intentional stance implies a kind of backward, teleological reasoning over causally related processes. A mental object like a  plan consists of a goal state (intention) and is produced by reasoning from goal to means (actions): this is what rational agency behavior is about. 

The mental world is not only a reflective one based in our minds eye. We may observe the stream of conscious mental processes, but the role of the mental conceptualizations is of even more important in understanding and communicating with other people. Mental processes and attitudes (sources of intention) are in the first place the building stones for modeling the minds of other people. The intentional stance means in the first place that we attribute to others and to some extent also to many animals intentions and intention directed mental processing and belief.
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Plan: A plan is a structure of multiple other plans or actions. These can be both sequential or concurrent. Usually a plan is referred to in the context of the intention to act of some agent, however when executed the plan itself comes into effect.
- Promise: A promise is a communicated attitude about some future action or state
- Proposition: A (non logical) proposition is a proposition qualified by a propositional attitude. NB: The proposition used here does not correspond to a proposition in proposition logics.
- Propositional_Attitude: A propositional attitude connects a person (the holder of the attitude) to some proposition, in fact it expresses some qualification over the proposition. Distinguishing a proposition from the propositional content expressed by it is necessary when properties relating to the thing expressed and properties of the expression itself must be distinguished. For LKIF the distinction between Belief, Intention, Qualification, and Observation is relevant. The distinction between belief/expectation, intention, and observation is relevant for i.a. establishing mens rea (guilty mind). The distinction between beliefs (expressing the content of the mind of an agent) and statements (expressing the content of an act of communication by an agent) is classical.
- Qualification: A qualification expresses e.g. a judgment. The thing qualified by the qualification is comparable to something else.

Each GPCR consists of a single polypeptide with an extracellular N-terminus, an intracellular C-terminus and seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM1-TM7) linked by three extracellular loops (ECL1-ECL3) and three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3). GPCRs function as part of a heterotrimeric complex to transmit an extracellular signal across the membrane by activating an associated G-protein via the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha subunit.
- cellular_component: A location, relative to cellular compartments and structures, occupied by a macromolecular machine. There are three types of cellular components described in the gene ontology: (1) the cellular anatomical entity where a gene product carries out a molecular function (e.g., plasma membrane, cytoskeleton) or membrane-enclosed compartments (e.g., mitochondrion); (2) virion components, where viral proteins act, and (3) the stable macromolecular complexes of which gene product are parts (e.g., the clathrin complex).
- channel protein: A protein that has channel activity. Channel proteins enable energy-independent facilitated diffusion, mediated by passage of a solute through a transmembrane aqueous pore or channel.

- fund prospectus: The Prospectus for the Fund. This is a document made available publicly for potential investors. It will include facts about the fund investment objective, investment focus and other details of the fund.

- fund reinvestment policy: Terms for the expected reinvestment of profits on fund units.
- fund subscription terms: Subscription terms for the fund. Further notes: ISO FIBIM, EFAMA DD and FPP combine terms for subscription, redemption and general holding requirements. These have been separated here as they are different kinds of term, but this can be reviewed. Subscription Terms are identified as terms of the fund and not the fund unit, since terms for how you might subscribe can't be binding one someone who has not yet subscribed.

	forking, merging, and joining of paths. Internal Markers will indicate
	the type of behavior control.
- Gateway Types: Icons within the diamond shape will
               indicate the type of flow control behavior.
	       The types of control include: 
	            1. exclusive -- exclusive decision and
	                merging. Both Data-Based and Event-Based. Data-Based 
			can be shown with or without the ""X"" marker.
 		    2. esclusive -- inclusive decision and merging
		    3. complex -- complex conditions and situations (e.g., 
		        3 out of 5)
  		    4. parallel -- forking and joining
               Each type of control affects both the
	       incoming and outgoing Flow.

Classes:
- Complex Work: Works that have other works as members. The members of a Complex Work may constitute alternatives to or derivatives of other members of the same Complex Work. Typically the members of the complex work represent the successive temporal versions of an act, while the complex work represents the act independantly of one of its version.
- Expression: The intellectual realisation of a Work in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as, but not limited to, text.

The substance of Expression is signs.

An Expression cannot exist without a physical carrier but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
- F1_Work
- F22_Self-Contained_Expression
- F3_Manifestation_Product_Type
- Format: The physical embodiment of a legal expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.
For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.
- Work: Any distinct intellectual creation (i.e., the intellectual content), in the context of ELI.

The substance of Work is ideas.

Classes:
- Absolute_Place: An absolute place is defined without reference to other places.
- Comprehensive_Place: A place is comprehensive if it always covers every place (and thus also every location-complex) and every object.
- Location_Complex: A location complex is a relatively stable complex of places referred to as one: it is the maximal collection of places with the same reference object.
- Occurrence: A consequence of our clear separation of ontology from models of situations (occurrences), is well exemplified in the two ways we look at time and space. Things happen against the canvas of space and time. This 3D canvas moving in time (or whatever metaphor) allows us to index instances of objects and processes. Time and space provide positions in time and space for objects. Positions are in general modeled in some mereological framework. However, the objects and processes as classes have time and space properties in a different way. Space occupied by an object is its inherent property of size or extension. This property was for Descartes even the critical one that separated mental (not: abstract) objects from physical ones. Processes occupy (consume) time; they take some duration. This time resource is inversely related to the consumption of energy. This distinction between position and extension is also made in various other ontologies. However, this distinction is easily obscured by the fact that the extension of an object can also be used as a reference for location. An object can be in another object. In fact, any physical object can be used as a spatial and even temporal referent. This does not refute our view that locations are occurrences. To be precise: extension is an inherent, necessary property of a physical object or process; its location is an accidental one.

Classes:
- Activity: An activity is a generic term for work that company
         performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic (compound). The types
	 of activities that are a part of a Process Model are: Process, 
	 Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are rounded rectangles. 
	 Processes are either unbounded or a contained within a Pool.
- ArtifactInput: artifact_input, which is used in the definition
	of attributes for all graphical elements.

- Condition: Condition, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Start Event and Intermediate Event, and which extends the
	set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).

	attributes for Activities and for attributes of a Process, and which 
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Message: Message, which is used in the definition of attributes
	for a Start Event, End Event, Intermediate Event, Task, and Message 
	Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see

- Multi Instance Loop Activity: An activity is a generic term 
	for work that company performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic
	(compound). The types of activities that are a part of a Process Model 
	are: Process, Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are 
	rounded rectangles. Processes are either unbounded or a contained 
	within a Pool.
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.

	attributes for a Process and common activity attributes, and which
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).

For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.

- Belief: Someting an agent 'believes in', i.e. holds as true
- Communicated_Attitude: A communictated attitude is a propositional attitude involved in an act of communication.
- Desire: A feeling of wanting
- Disallowed_Intention: The propositional content (i.e. that which is intended) of the intention is disallowed. Interesting concept for establishing mens rea (guilty mind), although 'disallowed' is a weaker qualification than criminal. Note the distinction between purposely committing a crime and knowingly committing a crime. The crime committed does not have to match the crime intended for establishing intent!
- Evaluative_Attitude: An evaluative attitude expresses e.g. a judgment. The proposition qualified by the evaluative attitude is comparable to something else.
- Evaluative_Proposition: Some thing which is evaluatively qualified, i.e. an evaluation applies to the proposition, the proposition is judged. The proposition is comparable to some other proposition.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Intention: Intention is where the agent expects certain consequences of his or her actions and desires those consequences to occur. This concept must be related to qualification and preference in some way.
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Organisation: An organisation is a group of other organisations or persons which acts 'as one'. An organisation can be both formal (i.e. created by law or decree) or informal.
- Promise: A promise is a communicated attitude about some future action or state
- Proposition: A (non logical) proposition is a proposition qualified by a propositional attitude. NB: The proposition used here does not correspond to a proposition in proposition logics.
- Propositional_Attitude: A propositional attitude connects a person (the holder of the attitude) to some proposition, in fact it expresses some qualification over the proposition. Distinguishing a proposition from the propositional content expressed by it is necessary when properties relating to the thing expressed and properties of the expression itself must be distinguished. For LKIF the distinction between Belief, Intention, Qualification, and Observation is relevant. The distinction between belief/expectation, intention, and observation is relevant for i.a. establishing mens rea (guilty mind). The distinction between beliefs (expressing the content of the mind of an agent) and statements (expressing the content of an act of communication by an agent) is classical.

                      usually in the context of B2B situations.
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.

Classes:
- Artifact: Artifacts are used to provide additional information 
	about the Process. There are three standardized Artifacts, but modelers
	or modeling tools are free to add as many Artifacts as required. There 
	may be addition BPMN efforts to standardize a larger set of Artifacts 
	for general use or for vertical markets. The current set of Artifacts 
	include: Data Object, Group, Annotation
- ArtifactOutput: artifact_output, which is used in the 
	definition of attributes for all graphical elements.
- Data Object: Data Objects are considered Artifacts because they
	do not have any direct effect on the Sequence Flow or Message Flow of 
	the Process, but they do provide information about what activities 
	require to be performed and/or what they produce.
- Embedded Sub-process
- Expression: Expression, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Start Event, Intermediate Event, Activity, Complex 
	Gateway, and Sequence Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN 
	Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Message: Message, which is used in the definition of attributes
	for a Start Event, End Event, Intermediate Event, Task, and Message 
	Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see 
	Table B.2)
- Output Set: OutputSet, which is used in the definition of 
	common attributes for Activities and for attributes of a Process, and 
	which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes 
	(see Table B.2).
- Participant: Participant, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Pool, Message, and Web service, and which extends the 
	set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.
- Property: Property, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Process and common activity attributes, and which
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Sequence Flow: A Sequence Flow is used to show the order that
              activities will be performed in a Process.
- Standard Loop Activity: An activity is a generic term for work 
	that company performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic 
	(compound). The types of activities that are a part of a Process Model 
	are: Process, Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are rounded
	rectangles. Processes are either unbounded or a contained within a

Classes:
- anatomical structure: Material anatomical entity that is a single connected structure with inherent 3D shape generated by coordinated expression of the organism's own genome.
- continuant
- generative cell nucleus: The nucleus of the generative cell, a cell contained within the pollen grain that will divide to produce two haploid sperm cells.
- germ cell nucleus: The nucleus of a germ cell, a reproductive cell in multicellular organisms.
- intracellular membrane-bounded organelle: Organized structure of distinctive morphology and function, bounded by a single or double lipid bilayer membrane and occurring within the cell. Includes the nucleus, mitochondria, plastids, vacuoles, and vesicles. Excludes the plasma membrane.
- left nucleus: One of the two nuclei found in Giardia species (trophozoite stage). It is located on the left side of the cell when viewed from the dorsal side.
- macronucleus: A membrane-bounded organelle of ciliated protozoan cells that contains polyploid copies of a portion of the cell's complete genome. Transcription of genes occurs in macronuclei. Some ciliate species may contain multiple macronuclei per cell.
- megasporocyte nucleus: The nucleus of a megasporocyte, a diploid cell that undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores, and its descendents.
- micronucleus: A membrane-bounded organelle of ciliated protozoan cells that contains a diploid copy of the cell's complete genome. Sections of contiguous sequence in the macronucleus are often interrupted by internal eliminated sequences (IES), and may be permuted, in micronuclei. Genic transcription is not found in micronuclei. Some ciliate species may contain multiple micronuclei per cell.
- microsporocyte nucleus: The nucleus of the microsporocyte. The microsporocyte is a diploid cell in which meiosis will occur, resulting in four microspores. A microspore is a spore that, in vascular plants, gives rise to a male gametophyte.
- nucleus: A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent.
- occurrent
- primary endosperm nucleus: Nucleus resulting from the fusion of the male gamete and two polar nuclei in the central cell of the embryo sac.
- pronucleus: The nucleus of either the ovum or the spermatozoon following fertilization. Thus, in the fertilized ovum, there are two pronuclei, one originating from the ovum, the other from the spermatozoon that brought about fertilization; they approach each other, but do not fuse until just before the first cleavage, when each pronucleus loses its membrane to release its contents.
- right nucleus: One of the two nuclei found in Giardia species (trophozoite stage). It is located on the right side of the cell when viewed from the dorsal side.

- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource: A work in a legislative corpus. This applies to acts that have been legally enacted (whether or not they are still in force).
For example, the abstract concept of the legal resource; e.g. ""act 3 of 2005"" (adapted from Akoma Ntoso)

A legal resource can represent a legal act or any component of a legal act, like an article.  Legal resources can be linked together using properties defined in the model.

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Legal Resource Subdivision: A component of a legal act, at an arbitrary level of precision, like a chapter, an article, an alinea, a paragraph or an list item. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using the properties eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.
- Organization: Institutions or groups of people that have obtained a legal recognition as a group and can act collectively as agents.
- Person: A real person who live or has lived.
- Work: Any distinct intellectual creation (i.e., the intellectual content), in the context of ELI.

The substance of Work is ideas.
- Work Subdivision: A component of a work, at an arbitrary level of precision. A subdivision can be linked with its parent and children subdivision using eli:has_part / eli:is_part_of.

- make securities available in market: What happens here? e.g. notices / marketing (phone calls) Structured Finance: There's not really notices in the newspaper, it's a very small market and it's all based on relationships so there's no public notice. So you would get an email from the sales person at the bank who has just closed the deal and is now selling these (this bank is the broker/dealer who bought it?) There's not really much of a secondary market - the initial investors would often hold on to these. There is something around Bloomberg - you can go there and see what's available, if someone has a number of notes from a iven tranche, that they are willing to sell. So there's no transpoarency (!!) Sales would be OTC but less transparent e.g. if you look up a normal OTC stock, you would be able to see more of this information, than in these (non Agency) MBS issues and other SF. DOES THIS APPLY IN ALL MBS??.

Classes:
- Activity: An activity is a generic term for work that company
         performs. An activity can be atomic or non-atomic (compound). The types
	 of activities that are a part of a Process Model are: Process, 
	 Sub-Process, and Task. Tasks and Sub-Processes are rounded rectangles. 
	 Processes are either unbounded or a contained within a Pool.
- Business Process Diagram: Gather the set of attributes of a 
	Business Process Diagram
- Category: Category, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for all BPMN elements, and which extends the set of common 
	BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2). Since a Category is also a 
	BPMN element, a Category can have Categories to create a hierarchical 
	structure of Categories.
- Condition: Condition, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for Start Event and Intermediate Event, and which extends the
	set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Embedded Sub-process
- Participant: Participant, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Pool, Message, and Web service, and which extends the 
	set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Pool: A Pool represents a Participant in a Process. It is
                      also acts as a ""swimlane"" and a graphical container
                      for partitioning a set of activities from other Pools,
                      usually in the context of B2B situations.
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.
- Property: Property, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Process and common activity attributes, and which
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Role: Role, which is used in the definition of attributes for 
	a Participant, and which extends the set of common BPMN Element 
	attributes (see Table B.2).

- Impiego: A Post represents some position within an organization that exists independently of the person or persons filling it. Posts may be used to represent situations where a person is a member of an organization ex officio (for example the Secretary of State for Scotland is part of UK Cabinet by virtue of being Secretary of State for Scotland, not as an individual person). A post can be held by multiple people and hence can be treated as a organization in its own right.
- Membership: Indicates the nature of an Agent's membership of an organization. Represents an n-ary relation between an Agent, an Organization and a Role. It is possible to directly indicate membership, independent of the specific Role, through use of the `org:memberOf` property.

- Organization
- OrganizationalUnit: An Organization such as a University Support Unit which is part of some larger FormalOrganization and only has full recognition within the context of that FormalOrganization, it is not a Legal Entity in its own right. Units can be large and complex containing other Units and even FormalOrganizations. Alternative names: _OU_ _Unit_ _Department_
- Partenariat: A collaboration between two or more Organizations such as a project. It meets the criteria for being an Organization in that it has an identity and defining purpose independent of its particular members but is neither a formally recognized legal entity nor a sub-unit within some larger organization. Might typically have a shorter lifetime than the Organizations within it, but not necessarily. All members are `org:Organization`s rather than individuals and those Organizations can play particular roles within the venture.

In most cases a Site will be a physical location. However, we don't exclude the possibility of non-physical sites such as a virtual office with an associated post box and phone reception service. Extensions may provide subclasses to denote particular types of site.
- organización formal: An Organization which is recognized in the world at large, in particular in legal jurisdictions, with associated rights and responsibilities. Examples include a Corporation, Charity, Government or Church. Note that this is a super class of `gr:BusinessEntity` and it is recommended to use the GoodRelations vocabulary to denote Business classifications such as DUNS or NAICS.

Once you get into the default scenario we are talking about a proces that is going to fall into place over a period of time. The bank works out what to do with the default scenario, e.g. whether it restructures, forecloses, seeks restitution from the security (collateral). It does nto help us to understand the structure of the loan, rather tha consequences of the loan. If we were to further explore the default detail we would bring in other SMEs. And we would have to model a process flow. 1.1 impact on the pool of an MBS Loan Default Proceeding (special ase of legal thing) is an aspect of Default Management / Administratoin. there is also the State of the Loan.

Classes:
- Activity
- Agent
- BusinessEntity
- Change Event: Represents an event which resulted in a major change to an organization such as a merger or complete restructuring. It is intended for situations where the resulting organization is sufficient distinct from the original organizations that it has a distinct identity and distinct URI. Extension vocabularies should define sub-classes of this to denote particular categories of event. The instant or interval at which the event occurred should be given by `prov:startAtTime` and `prov:endedAtTime`, a description should be given by `dct:description`.
- Committee member: Class that describes the member a committee.
- Concept
- Membership: Indicates the nature of an Agent's membership of an organization. Represents an n-ary relation between an Agent, an Organization and a Role. It is possible to directly indicate membership, independent of the specific Role, through use of the `org:memberOf` property.
- Organization
- Organization
- OrganizationalUnit: An Organization such as a University Support Unit which is part of some larger FormalOrganization and only has full recognition within the context of that FormalOrganization, it is not a Legal Entity in its own right. Units can be large and complex containing other Units and even FormalOrganizations. Alternative names: _OU_ _Unit_ _Department_
- Partenariat: A collaboration between two or more Organizations such as a project. It meets the criteria for being an Organization in that it has an identity and defining purpose independent of its particular members but is neither a formally recognized legal entity nor a sub-unit within some larger organization. Might typically have a shorter lifetime than the Organizations within it, but not necessarily. All members are `org:Organization`s rather than individuals and those Organizations can play particular roles within the venture. Alternative names: _Project_ _Venture_  _Endeavour_ _Consortium_ _Endeavour_
- Person
- Rôle: Denotes a role that a Person or other Agent can take in an organization. Instances of this class describe the abstract role; to denote a specific instance of a person playing that role in a specific organization use an instance of `org:Membership`. It is common for roles to be arranged in some taxonomic structure and we use SKOS to represent that. The normal SKOS lexical properties should be used when labelling the Role. Additional descriptive properties for the Role, such as a Salary band, may be added by extension vocabularies.
- Sede: An office or other premise at which the organization is located. Many organizations are spread across multiple sites and many sites will host multiple locations. In most cases a Site will be a physical location. However, we don't exclude the possibility of non-physical sites such as a virtual office with an associated post box and phone reception service. Extensions may provide subclasses to denote particular types of site.
- organización formal: An Organization which is recognized in the world at large, in particular in legal jurisdictions, with associated rights and responsibilities. Examples include a Corporation, Charity, Government or Church. Note that this is a super class of `gr:BusinessEntity` and it is recommended to use the GoodRelations vocabulary to denote Business classifications such as DUNS or NAICS.
