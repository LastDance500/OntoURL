Classes:
- Assertion: The assertion is subject to a fit between words and world, in Searle's terms. It's propositional content can be true of false. If it is inconsistent with other assertions, beliefs, observations, it may come to be considered false.
- Collaborative_Plan: A collaborative plan is a plan which is shared (and executed) between at least two agents a and b.
- Declaration: Searle: the successful performance of a declaration is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true. In other words, if there is an inconsistency between the declaration and assertions, beliefs, or observations, it is not the declaration that is false. True of definitions and norms, and several other performative statements by legislators.
- Evaluative_Expression: A legal evaluative expression asserts that something is good or bad, is a value to be optimised or an evil to be minimised (for example “human dignity is value”, “participation ought to be promoted”);
- Evaluative_Proposition: Some thing which is evaluatively qualified, i.e. an evaluation applies to the proposition, the proposition is judged. The proposition is comparable to some other proposition.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Legal_Expression: Legal expressions are created by  some legal speech act and qualified by a communicated attitude
- Medium
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Personal_Plan: A personal plan is a plan which is held (and can be executed) by at most one agent.
- Plan: A plan is a structure of multiple other plans or actions. These can be both sequential or concurrent. Usually a plan is referred to in the context of the intention to act of some agent, however when executed the plan itself comes into effect.
- Promise: A promise is a communicated attitude about some future action or state
- Proposition: A (non logical) proposition is a proposition qualified by a propositional attitude. NB: The proposition used here does not correspond to a proposition in proposition logics.
- Propositional_Attitude: A propositional attitude connects a person (the holder of the attitude) to some proposition, in fact it expresses some qualification over the proposition. Distinguishing a proposition from the propositional content expressed by it is necessary when properties relating to the thing expressed and properties of the expression itself must be distinguished. For LKIF the distinction between Belief, Intention, Qualification, and Observation is relevant. The distinction between belief/expectation, intention, and observation is relevant for i.a. establishing mens rea (guilty mind). The distinction between beliefs (expressing the content of the mind of an agent) and statements (expressing the content of an act of communication by an agent) is classical.

It surrounds the rostral part of the brain and interhemispheric commissure and forms part of the limbic system. (MSH) One of three essential structures comprising the limbic lobe, the other two being the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. (CSP).
- frontal gyrus: A gyrus that is part of a frontal cortex.
- gyrus: A ridge on the cerebral cortex. It is generally surrounded by one or more sulci .
- inferior frontal gyrus: Component of the frontal lobe, lateral aspect. The rostral boundary is the first appearance of the inferior frontal sulcus whereas the caudal boundary is the precentral gyrus. The medial and lateral boundaries are the lateral bank of the inferior frontal sulcus and the medial bank of the lateral orbital sulcus and/or the circular insular sulcus respectively (Christein Fennema-Notestine).
- inferior temporal gyrus: Component of the temporal lobe, lateral aspect. The rostral boundary is the rostral extent of the inferior temporal sulcus whereas the caudal boundary is designated as the temporo-occipital incisure on the cortical surface. The occipitotemporal sulcus is the medial boundary and the inferior temporal sulcus is the lateral boundary (Christine Fennema-Notestine).

- parahippocampal gyrus: Component of the temporal lobe on the mesial surface, posterior to the entorhinal cortex. The rostral and caudal boundaries are the posterior end of the netorhinal cortex and the caudal portion of the hippocampus, respectively. The medial boudnary is designated as the medial aspect off the temporal lobe and the lateral boundary is the collateral sulcus (Christine Fennema-Notestine).
- postcentral gyrus: Component of the parietal lobe. The appearance and disappearance of the central sulcus were the rostral and caudal boundaries of the postcentral gyrus respectively. The medial and lateral boundaries were the lateral bank of the precentral gyrus and the lateral fissure and/or the medial bank of the superior parietal gyrus respectively (Christine Fennema-Notestine).
- posterior cingulate gyrus: The posterior cingulate cortex is the backmost part of the cingulate cortex, lying behind the anterior cingulate cortex. This is the upper part of the 'limbic lobe'. The cingulate cortex is made up of an area around the midline of the brain. Surrounding areas include the retrosplenial cortex and the precuneus. Cytoarchitectonically posterior cingulate cortex is associated with Brodmann areas 23 and 31. [WP,unvetted].
- rostral middle frontal gyrus: Component of the middle frontal gyrus The rostral boundary is the first appearance of the superior frontal sulcus whereas the caudal boundary is the middle frontal gyrus. The medial and lateral boundaries are the superior frontal sulcus and the inferior frontal sulcus respectively (Christine Fennema-Notestine).

The rostral boundary is the first appearance of the superior frontal sulcus whereas the caudal boundary is the midpoint of the paracentral sulcus on the 'inflated' surface. The medial and lateral boundaries are the medial aspect of the frontal lobe and the superior frontal sulcus respectively (Christine Fennema-Notestine).
- transverse gyrus of Heschl: The area of the temporal lobe concerned with hearing[MP]. The transverse temporal gyri (also called Heschl's gyri or Heschl's convolutions) are found in the area of primary auditory cortex in the superior temporal gyrus of the human brain, occupying Brodmann areas 41 and 42. It is the first cortical structure to process incoming auditory information. Anatomically, the transverse temporal gyri are distinct in that they run mediolaterally (towards the center of the brain) rather than dorsiventrally (front to back) as all other temporal lobe gyri run.

	forking, merging, and joining of paths. Internal Markers will indicate
	the type of behavior control.
- Gateway Types: Icons within the diamond shape will
               indicate the type of flow control behavior.
	       The types of control include: 
	            1. exclusive -- exclusive decision and
	                merging. Both Data-Based and Event-Based. Data-Based 
			can be shown with or without the ""X"" marker.

		    3. complex -- complex conditions and situations (e.g., 
		        3 out of 5)
  		    4. parallel -- forking and joining
               Each type of control affects both the
	       incoming and outgoing Flow.
- Intermediate: Intermediate Events occur between a Start
                    Event and an End Event. It will affect the
		    flow of the process, but will not start or
		    (directly) terminate the process.

Classes:
- DNA damage response: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus indicating damage to its DNA from environmental insults or errors during metabolism.
- DNA metabolic process: Any cellular metabolic process involving deoxyribonucleic acid. This is one of the two main types of nucleic acid, consisting of a long, unbranched macromolecule formed from one, or more commonly, two, strands of linked deoxyribonucleotides.
- DNA repair: The process of restoring DNA after damage. Genomes are subject to damage by chemical and physical agents in the environment (e.g. UV and ionizing radiations, chemical mutagens, fungal and bacterial toxins, etc.) and by free radicals or alkylating agents endogenously generated in metabolism. DNA is also damaged because of errors during its replication. A variety of different DNA repair pathways have been reported that include direct reversal, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, photoreactivation, bypass, double-strand break repair pathway, and mismatch repair pathway.
- DNA replication proofreading: Correction of replication errors by DNA polymerase using a 3'-5' exonuclease activity.
- chromosomal 5-methylcytosine DNA demethylation, oxidative deamination pathway: An epigenetic cytosine DNA demethylation pathway that includes a deamination step to produce either a thymine (T), or a 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU), if the 5meC had first been converted to 5hmC. A DNA glycosylase (e. g. TDG) recognizes the T mispaired with a G or the 5hmC and excises the modified base to initiate its replacement with unmethylated cytosine through base excision repair.
- double-strand break repair: The repair of double-strand breaks in DNA via homologous and nonhomologous mechanisms to reform a continuous DNA helix.
- double-strand break repair via nonhomologous end joining: The repair of a double-strand break in DNA in which the two broken ends are rejoined with little or no sequence complementarity. Information at the DNA ends may be lost due to the modification of broken DNA ends. This term covers instances of separate pathways, called classical (or canonical) and alternative nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ and A-NHEJ). These in turn may further branch into sub-pathways, but evidence is still unclear.
- double-strand break repair via single-strand annealing: Repair of a DSB made between two repeated sequences oriented in the same direction occurs primarily by the single strand annealing pathway. The ends of the break are processed by a 5' to 3' exonuclease, exposing complementary single-strand regions of the direct repeats that can anneal, resulting in a deletion of the unique DNA between the direct repeats.
- mismatch repair: A system for the correction of errors in which an incorrect base, which cannot form hydrogen bonds with the corresponding base in the parent strand, is incorporated into the daughter strand. The mismatch repair system promotes genomic fidelity by repairing base-base mismatches, insertion-deletion loops and heterologies generated during DNA replication and recombination.
- non-photoreactive DNA repair: A DNA repair process that is involved in repairing UV-induced DNA damage under non-photoreactivating conditions. The mechanism by which this repair process operates has not yet been completely elucidated.
- nucleotide-excision repair: A DNA repair process in which a small region of the strand surrounding the damage is removed from the DNA helix as an oligonucleotide. The small gap left in the DNA helix is filled in by the sequential action of DNA polymerase and DNA ligase. Nucleotide excision repair recognizes a wide range of substrates, including damage caused by UV irradiation (pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) and chemicals (intrastrand cross-links and bulky adducts).
- protein-DNA covalent cross-linking repair: The removal of covalent cross-link between DNA and a protein.
- pyrimidine dimer repair: The repair of UV-induced T-T, C-T and C-C dimers.
- recombinational repair: A DNA repair process that involves the exchange, reciprocal or nonreciprocal, of genetic material between the broken DNA molecule and a homologous DNA region.
- single strand break repair: The repair of single strand breaks in DNA. Repair of such breaks is mediated by the same enzyme systems as are used in base excision repair.",,"(DNA repair, subClassOf, DNA metabolic process)

Classes:
- Agent: Additional comment: a computational agent can be considered as a PhysicalAgent that realizes a certain class of algorithms (that can be considered as instances of InformationObject) that allow to obtain some behaviors that are considered typical of agents in general. For an ontology of computational objects based on DOLCE see e.g. http://www.loa-cnr.it/COS/COS.owl, and http://www.loa-cnr.it/KCO/KCO.owl.
- Collective agent: A SocialAgent that is actedBy agents that are (and act as) members of a Collective. A collective agent can have roles that are also roles of those agents.
For example, in sociology, a 'group action' is the situation in which a number of people (that result to be members of a collective) in a given area behave in a coordinated way in order to achieve a (often common) goal. The Agent in such a Situation is not single, but a CollectiveAgent (a Group). This can be generalized to the notion of social movement, which assumes a large Community or even the entire Society as agents.
The difference between a CollectiveAgent and an Organization is that a Description that introduces a CollectiveAgent is also one that unifies the corresponding Collective. In practice, this difference makes collective agents 'less stable' than organizations, because they have a dedicated, publicly recognizable Description that is conceived to introduce them.
- Organization: An internally structured, conventionally created SocialAgent, needing a specific Role and Agent that plays it, in order to act.
- Personification: A social entity with agentive features, but whose status is the result of a cultural transformation from e.g. a PhysicalObject, an Event, an Abstract, another SocialObject, etc. For example: the holy grail, deus ex machina, gods, magic wands, etc.
- Social agent: Any individual whose existence is granted simply by its social communicability and capability of action (through some PhysicalAgent).
- Social object: Any Object that exists only within some communication Event, in which at least one PhysicalObject participates in. 
In other words, all objects that have been or are created in the process of social communication: for the sake of communication (InformationObject), for incorporating new individuals (SocialAgent, Place), for contextualizing existing entities (Situation), for collecting existing entities (Collection), or for describing existing entities (Description, Concept).
Being dependent on communication, all social objects need to be expressed by some information object (information object are self-expressing).
- Social person: A SocialAgent that needs the existence of a specific NaturalPerson in order to act (but the lifetime of the NaturalPerson has only to overlap that of the SocialPerson).
- concept: Any non-tangible notion or idea that can be referred to but does not fit the other top level classes. 

E.g.: the approval of an act, peace, child, Mickey Mouse, John Constantine, a class of an ontology.
- continuant
- expression: Any version of a FRBR Work whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc. 

E.g.: act 3 of 2005 as in the version following the amendments entered into force on July 3rd, 2006.
- location: A location that can be referred to also using geographical coordinates. 

E.g.: the Rio river, Marrakesh, the entrance to the Black Forrest.
- material entity
- role: A part played by a person or an organization, in a certain situation. 

E.g.: member of parliament, speaker, head of office, bill proposer.
- term: A word or group of words whose meaning is defined in a formal and precise manner by means of a specific concept. 

E.g.: opening sentence, rebuttal, impeachment.
- work: The abstract concept of a legal resource.

Classes:
- Assumption: proposes something that usually is the case, although there is no specific evidence that it is true in this particular case
- Cause: A cause is an epistemic role played by something which is the outcome of a (chain) of processes
- Epistemic_Role: The role of something used in a (mental) reasoning/inference process
- Evidence: Observation and/or statement, used as a backing for a belief. Evidence is the role of observation which is qualified by some belief.
- Exception: An exception is something that is excluded from a general statement or does not follow a rule. In LKIF rules, an exception is a rule which has an exception relation to another rule (cf. Deliverable 1.1)
- Expectation: An expectation is a predictive belief held on purely logical grounds, i.e. not based on direct external evidence, like an observation or a statement by another agent. It is also often characterized as a ""belief about the future"", but this isn't very helpful since one may also hold expectations about the (yet unknown) past. The theory of evolution is for instance a fertile ground for predictions about the existence of past species, and therefore at the same a predictor of future observations.
- Fact: A fact is a proposition (about something) which is (commonly) agreed upon to hold as true: it has some backing in evidence
- Function: The use or purpose of some object as used in some context.
- Observation: An observation is the role played by some proposition believed to be true or false through observation of an agent.
- Problem: A problem is an observation that deviates from an Intention.
- Reason: Teleological counterpart of cause
- Role: A role is a specification of default behavior and accompanying expectations of the thing 'playing' the role. Similar to actors in a theater who play roles, but are not the roles. Example: student.
- Social_Role: A social role is played by some agent in the context of social activities. The social role brings with it some expectation of 'default' behavior of the role-filler.
- Subjective_Entity: A subjective entity is ontologically subjective, i.e. its existence is relative to an observer, that attributes its properties to some other entity, given a context.
- Surprise: A surprise is an observation that deviates from an expectation.",,"(Assumption, subClassOf, Epistemic_Role)

- Thiazolidinedione Antidiabetic Agent: Any antidiabetic agent with the glitazone (thiazolidinedione) base structure with antihyperglycemic activity. Glitazone antidiabetic agents selectively bind to and stimulate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma. This results in the selective transcription of a number of insulin-sensitive genes involved in glucose metabolism. This eventually enhances insulin sensitivity, reduces insulin resistance and decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis. PPARs function as transcription factors that regulate expressions of genes involved in cellular differentiation, development, and metabolism (carbohydrate, lipid, protein), as well as tumorigenesis; PPARgamma is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue.

- Precedent: In law, a precedent or authority is a legal case establishing a principle or rule that a court may need to adopt when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts. The term may also refer to the collective body of case law that a court should consider when interpreting the law. When a precedent establishes an important legal principle, or represents new or changed law on a particular issue, that precedent is often known as a landmark decision.

Classes:
- appendicitis: An appendix disease that involves inflammation and infection of the appendix caused by the blockage of the lumen with a small, hard piece of stool, a foreign body or worms. Mucus backs up in the appendiceal lumen, causing bacteria that live inside the appendix to multiply. The infection has_symptom pain, in the upper abdomen initially and later in the lower abdomen, has_symptom nausea, has_symptom vomiting and has_symptom fever.
- appendix disease: A gastrointestinal system disease that is located_in the appendix.
- diarrhea: A gastrointestinal system disease described as the condition of having frequent loose or liquid bowel movements. Acute diarrhea is a common cause of death in developing countries and the second most common cause of infant deaths worldwide. The loss of fluids through diarrhea can cause severe dehydration which is one cause of death in diarrhea sufferers. Along with water, sufferers also lose dangerous amounts of important salts, electrolytes, and other nutrients. There are at least four types of diarrhea: secretory diarrhea, osmotic diarrhea, motility-related diarrhea, and inflammatory diarrhea.
- disease of anatomical entity: A disease that disrupts the functioning of an anatomical entity.
- esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula: A gastrointestinal system disease that is characterized by abnormal development of the esophagus and trachea where the upper esophagus does not connect (atresia) to the lower esophagus and stomach and may also include tracheoesophageal fistula where the esophagus and the trachea are abnormally connected which allows fluids from the esophagus to get into the airways and interfere with breathing.
- gastroenteritis: A gastrointestinal system infectious disease that involves inflammation of the lining of the stomach and small and large intestines, which is caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Chemicals and drugs also cause gastroenteritis. The symptoms include diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, cramps, and discomfort in the abdomen.
- gastrointestinal system disease: A disease of anatomical entity that is located_in the gastrointestinal tract.
- inflammatory diarrhea: A gastrointestinal system infectious disease involving diarrhea that occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids, and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.
- intestinal disease: A gastrointestinal system disease that is located_in the intestine.
- motility-related diarrhea: A diarrhea which is caused by the rapid movement of food through the intestines (hypermotility). If the food moves too quickly through the GI tract, there is not enough time for sufficient nutrients and water to be absorbed.
- osmotic diarrhea: A dirrhea that occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels. This can be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Osmotic diarrhea can also be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who does not have lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products.
- perinatal necrotizing enterocolitis
- peritonitis: A gastrointestinal system disease that involves inflammation of the peritoneum resulting from perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, which produces immediate chemical inflammation followed shortly by infection from intestinal organisms. Peritonitis can also result from appendicitis, diverticulitis, strangulating intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, mesenteric ischemia, intraperitoneal blood, barium, or peritoneo-systemic shunts, drains, and dialysis catheters in the peritoneal cavity. The symptoms include abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, fluid in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting and low urine output.
- secretory diarrhea: A diarrhea where there is an increase in the active secretion, or there is an inhibition of absorption causing little to no structural damage. The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions, especially chloride ions.

- aldoxorubicin: Aldoxorubicin is a 6-maleimidocaproyl hydrazone derivative prodrug of the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin (DOXO-EMCH) with antineoplastic activity. Following intravenous administration, aldoxorubicin binds selectively to the cysteine-34 position of albumin via its maleimide moiety. Doxorubicin is released from the albumin carrier after cleavage of the acid-sensitive hydrazone linker within the acidic environment of tumors and, once located intracellularly, intercalates DNA, inhibits DNA synthesis, and induces apoptosis. Albumin tends to accumulate in solid tumors as a result of high metabolic turnover, rapid angiogenesis, hypervasculature, and impaired lymphatic drainage. Because of passive accumulation within tumors, this agent may improve the therapeutic effects of doxorubicin while minimizing systemic toxicity. (NCIt)

- Pool: A Pool represents a Participant in a Process. It is
                      also acts as a ""swimlane"" and a graphical container
                      for partitioning a set of activities from other Pools,
                      usually in the context of B2B situations.
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.
- Property: Property, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Process and common activity attributes, and which
	extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).

Classes:
- G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway: A G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway initiated by a ligand binding to an acetylcholine receptor on the surface of a target cell, and ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription.
- G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway involved in heart process: A G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway, which contributes to a circulatory system process carried out by the heart.
- G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway involved in negative regulation of heart rate: A G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway that contributes to a decrease in frequency or rate of heart contraction. Binding of acetylcholine to a G protein-coupled (muscarinic) receptor on the surface of the signal-receiving cell results in the alpha subunit of a coupled G-protein binding to GTP. This results in the separation of the beta-gamma complex from the alpha subunit. Both the alpha subunit, and the beta-gamma complex can continue to signal to bring about membrane hyperpolarization and a reduction in heart rate.
- G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway involved in positive regulation of acetylcholine secretion, neurotransmission: Any G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway that is involved in positive regulation of acetylcholine secretion, neurotransmission.
- G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway: The series of molecular signals initiated by a ligand binding to its receptor, in which the activated receptor promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha-subunit of an associated heterotrimeric G-protein complex. The GTP-bound activated alpha-G-protein then dissociates from the beta- and gamma-subunits to further transmit the signal within the cell. The pathway begins with receptor-ligand interaction, and ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process. The pathway can start from the plasma membrane, Golgi or nuclear membrane.
- G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway involved in heart process: An G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway which contributes to a circulatory system process carried out by the heart.
- acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway: The series of molecular signals generated as a consequence of an acetylcholine receptor binding to one of its physiological ligands.
- adenylate cyclase-activating adrenergic receptor signaling pathway: An adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway initiated by a ligand binding to an adrenergic receptor on the surface of the target cell, and ending with the regulation of a downstream cellular process.
- adenylate cyclase-activating adrenergic receptor signaling pathway involved in cardiac muscle relaxation: An adrenergic receptor signaling pathway that contributes to a reduction in cardiac muscle contraction. Beta-adrenergic receptor-induced cardiac relaxation is achieved by a GPCR-activated adenylate cyclase generating cAMP; cAMP then activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane protein PLB. In its non-phosphorylated state, PLB acts as an inhibitor of the ATPase Ca(2+) pump of the cardiac SR (SERCA2a); inhibition of the pump is relieved upon phosphorylation. The pump removes Ca(2+) from the cytoplasm, thereby preventing cytosolic Ca(2+)-dependent activation of contractile proteins, leading to enhanced muscle relaxation.
- adenylate cyclase-activating adrenergic receptor signaling pathway involved in heart process: The series of molecular signals beginning with a G protein-coupled adrenergic cell surface receptor combining with epinephrine or norepinephrine, to activate adenylate cyclase, which contributes to a circulatory system process carried out by the heart.
- adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway: An adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway initiated by acetylcholine binding to its receptor, and ending with the regulation of a downstream cellular process.
- adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway: A G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway in which the signal is transmitted via the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and a subsequent decrease in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP).
- angiotensin-activated signaling pathway involved in heart process: An angiotensin receptor signaling pathway which contributes to a circulatory system process carried out by the heart.
- endothelin receptor signaling pathway involved in heart process: An endothelin receptor signaling pathway which contributes to a circulatory system process carried out by the heart.

Classes:
- Exclusionary_Right: An exclusionary right concerns the prohibition against performing certain inferences (against reasoning in certain ways), or 
against using certain kinds of premises for certain purposes, in the interest of a particular person. This is especially the case with anti-discrimination rules.
- Liability_Right: A liability right expresses some right to act that brings with it some liability to perform another (compensating) act. For instance, if some k performs the permitted action A, then k will have to perform another action B for the benefit of j.
- Liberty_Right: When, for the benefit of a person, this person is both permitted to perform and to omit an action – that is, when the action is facultative – we can say that he or she has a liberty right with regard to that action.
- Norm: A norm is a kind of Qualification. A qualification which normatively qualifies some thing (i.e. some normatively qualified): i.e. a qualification which allows or disallows some thing.
- Obligation: See prohibition
- Obligative_Right: Directed obligative ought-to-do are also called obligative rights. k has the obligative  right that j does A iff it is obligatory, toward k, that j does A. An example of obligative  right is “it is obligatory, toward Mary, that Tom pays 1,000 euro to John”
- Permission: Permission allows propositions, to which therefore the predication Allowed applies. The thing(s) allowed is/are a subset of the thing(s) qualified by the permission. If S then P(A) means that S is qualified and S and A is allowed.
- Permissive_Right: The  negation of a directed obligation is a directed permission. However, it counts as a right,  namely, a permissive right, only when such negation is aimed at benefitting the author of  the permitted action.
- Prohibition: Prohibition obliges/allows thing(s), to which therefore the predication Obliged applies, and disallows thing(s), to which therefore the predication Disallowed applies. The union of the thing(s) allowed and the thing(s) disallowed is qualified by the prohibition. The things allowed and disallowed by the prohibition are disjoint (and completely partition the space of things qualified). If S then O(A) means that S is qualified, S and A is obliged/allowed, and S and not A is disallowed. If S then F(A) means that S is qualified, S and A is disallowed, and S and not A is obliged/allowed. The difference between Obligation and Prohibition is in which part of the partition of the qualified space is explicitly described by the normative statement. Alternative label: directive

Classes:
- 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis: Gonadal dysgenesis with a karyotype of 46,XX. Streak ovaries are present with non-functional tissues unable to produce the required sex steroid estrogen. Low levels of oestrogen effect the HPG axis with no feedback to the anterior pituitary to inhibit the secretion of FSH and LH. FSH and LH are secreted at abnormal elevated levels. Improper levels of these hormones will cause a failure to initiate puberty, undergo menarche, and develop secondary sex characteristics. If sufficient functional ovarian tissue is present, limited menstrual cycles can occur.

Classes:
- Exclusionary_Right: An exclusionary right concerns the prohibition against performing certain inferences (against reasoning in certain ways), or 
against using certain kinds of premises for certain purposes, in the interest of a particular person. This is especially the case with anti-discrimination rules.
- Liability_Right: A liability right expresses some right to act that brings with it some liability to perform another (compensating) act. For instance, if some k performs the permitted action A, then k will have to perform another action B for the benefit of j.
- Liberty_Right: When, for the benefit of a person, this person is both permitted to perform and to omit an action – that is, when the action is facultative – we can say that he or she has a liberty right with regard to that action.
- Norm: A norm is a kind of Qualification. A qualification which normatively qualifies some thing (i.e. some normatively qualified): i.e. a qualification which allows or disallows some thing.
- Obligation: See prohibition
- Obligative_Right: Directed obligative ought-to-do are also called obligative rights. k has the obligative  right that j does A iff it is obligatory, toward k, that j does A. An example of obligative  right is “it is obligatory, toward Mary, that Tom pays 1,000 euro to John”
- Permission: Permission allows propositions, to which therefore the predication Allowed applies. The thing(s) allowed is/are a subset of the thing(s) qualified by the permission. If S then P(A) means that S is qualified and S and A is allowed.
- Permissive_Right: The  negation of a directed obligation is a directed permission. However, it counts as a right,  namely, a permissive right, only when such negation is aimed at benefitting the author of  the permitted action.
- Prohibition: Prohibition obliges/allows thing(s), to which therefore the predication Obliged applies, and disallows thing(s), to which therefore the predication Disallowed applies. The union of the thing(s) allowed and the thing(s) disallowed is qualified by the prohibition. The things allowed and disallowed by the prohibition are disjoint (and completely partition the space of things qualified). If S then O(A) means that S is qualified, S and A is obliged/allowed, and S and not A is disallowed. If S then F(A) means that S is qualified, S and A is disallowed, and S and not A is obliged/allowed. The difference between Obligation and Prohibition is in which part of the partition of the qualified space is explicitly described by the normative statement. Alternative label: directive

- amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation cell: A cell that originates in the neural crest, that has certain cytochemical and ultrastructural characteristics and is found scattered throughout the body; types include melanocytes, the cells of the chromaffin system, and cells in the hypothalamus, hypophysis, thyroid, parathyroids, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. This cell type concentrates the amino acid precursors of certain amines and decarboxylate them, forming amines that function as regulators and neurotransmitters. This cell type produces substances such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, enkephalin, somatostatin, neurotensin, and substance P, the actions of which may affect contiguous cells, nearby groups of cells, or distant cells, thus functioning as local or systemic hormones. The name is an acronym for amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation cell.
- chromaffin cell: A cell that stores epinephrine secretory vesicles. During times of stress, the nervous system signals the vesicles to secrete their hormonal content. Their name derives from their ability to stain a brownish color with chromic salts. Characteristically, they are located in the adrenal medulla and paraganglia of the sympathetic nervous system.
- chromaffin cell of adrenal gland: A chromaffin cell that is part of the adrenal gland.
- chromaffin cell of left ovary: A chromaffin cell that is part of the left ovary.
- chromaffin cell of ovary: A chromaffin cell that is part of the ovary.

Classes:
- cellular response to misfolded protein: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a misfolded protein stimulus.
- cellular response to stress: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus indicating the organism is under stress. The stress is usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation).
- cellular response to topologically incorrect protein: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a protein that is not folded in its correct three-dimensional structure.
- cellular response to unfolded protein: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an unfolded protein stimulus.
- detection of chemical stimulus: The series of events in which a chemical stimulus is received by a cell and converted into a molecular signal.
- multicellular organismal response to stress: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a multicellular organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus indicating the organism is under stress. The stress is usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation).
- phage shock: A response by bacterial cells to a variety of stresses including filamentous phage infection, mislocalization of envelope proteins, extremes of temperature, osmolarity or ethanol concentration, and the presence of proton ionophores such as carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), that involves expression of the phage shock protein operon, and acts to protect the bacterial cells from damage.
- response to isolation stress: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a lack of contact with other members of the same species.
- response to misfolded protein: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a misfolded protein stimulus.
- response to nitrosative stress: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a nitrosative stress stimulus. Nitrosative stress is a state often resulting from exposure to high levels of nitric oxide (NO) or the highly reactive oxidant peroxynitrite, which is produced following interaction of NO with superoxide anions.
- response to sterol depletion: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus indicating deprivation of sterols. Sterols are a group of steroids characterized by the presence of one or more hydroxyl groups and a hydrocarbon side-chain in the molecule.
- response to stress: Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a disturbance in organismal or cellular homeostasis, usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation).

- circular nucleus of antherior hypothalamic nucleus: A group of cells located in the central part of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamic region of the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Paxinos-2001 ). Functionally it belongs to the magnocellular neuroendocrine cell groups of the subcortical motor system ( Swanson-2004 ).
- dorsal premammillary nucleus
- hypothalamic nucleus: A nucleus of brain that is part of a hypothalamus.
- lateral hypothalamic nucleus: The lateral hypothalamus or lateral hypothalamic area is a part of the hypothalamus. It is concerned with hunger. Damage to this area can cause reduced food intake. Stimulating the lateral hypothalamus causes a desire to eat, while stimulating the ventromedial hypothalamus causes a desire to stop eating.
- lateral tuberal nucleus: Nerve cell nuclei situated ventrally in the intermediate hypothalamic region, mainly in the lateral hypothalamic area.
- medial preoptic nucleus: The medial preoptic nucleus is bounded laterally by the lateral preoptic nucleus, and medially by the preoptic periventricular nucleus. It releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone, controls copulation in males, and is larger in males than in females.[WP,unvetted].
- nucleus lateralis tuberis system (sensu Teleostei): A prominent nucleus located in the ventral tuberal area of Teleostei that is anatomically homologous to the hypothalamic arcuate (infundibular)-median eminence (ME) system of tetrpods.
- nucleus recessus preopticus
- periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, intermediate part: The intermediate part of the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus.
- periventricular nucleus of hypothalamus: A small nucleus at the base of the hypothalamus, adjacent to the arcuate nucleus.
- posterior periventricular nucleus
- premammillary nucleus
- preoptic nucleus: A nucleus of brain that is part of a preoptic area.
- tuberal supraoptic nucleus: Posterior division of the supraoptic nucleus, formed by the ascension of the optic tract splitting the nucleus into two regions. The tuberal SON lies along the posterior tuber cinereum of the hypothalamus. In some species, some neurons lie under the optic chiasm.

Classes:
- Malpighian tubule stellate cell differentiation: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of a Malpighian tubule stellate cell. A Malpighian tubule stellate cell is a specialized epithelial secretory cell that moves chloride ions and water across the tubule epithelium.
- cell differentiation involved in embryonic placenta development: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of the embryonic placenta.
- epidermal cell differentiation: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of an epidermal cell, any of the cells making up the epidermis.
- epithelial cell differentiation: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of an epithelial cell, any of the cells making up an epithelium.
- epithelial cell differentiation involved in embryonic placenta development: The process in which a trophoblast cell acquires specialized features of an epithelial cell of the placental labyrinthine layer.
- epithelial cell differentiation involved in kidney development: The process in which relatively unspecialized cells acquire specialized structural and/or functional features of an epithelial cell that characterize the cells of the kidney as it progresses from its formation to the mature state.
- epithelial cell differentiation involved in prostate gland development: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of an epithelial cell of the prostate gland.
- hair cell differentiation: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of a hair cell.

- lens fiber cell differentiation: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of a lens fiber cell, any of the elongated, tightly packed cells that make up the bulk of the mature lens in the camera-type eye. The cytoplasm of a lens fiber cell is devoid of most intracellular organelles including the cell nucleus, and contains primarily crystallins, a group of water-soluble proteins expressed in vary large quantities.
- limb basal epidermal cell differentiation: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of a limb epidermal basal cell. A epidermal basal cell cell is a cell that retains the ability to divide and proliferate throughout life to provide progenitor cells that can differentiate into more specialized cell of the limb epidermis.
- neuron differentiation: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of a neuron.
- polarized epithelial cell differentiation: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of a polarized epithelial cell. The polarized epithelial cell can be any of the cells within an epithelium where the epithelial sheet is oriented with respect to the planar axis.
- sebaceous gland cell differentiation: The process in which a relatively unspecialized epidermal cell acquires the specialized features of a sebaceous gland cell.

- axon collateral: Any of the smaller branches of an axon that emanate from the main axon cylinder.
- cell division site: The eventual plane of cell division (also known as cell cleavage or cytokinesis) in a dividing cell. In Eukaryotes, the cleavage apparatus, composed of septin structures and the actomyosin contractile ring, forms along this plane, and the mitotic, or meiotic, spindle is aligned perpendicular to the division plane. In bacteria, the cell division site is generally located at mid-cell and is the site at which the cytoskeletal structure, the Z-ring, assembles.
- cellular anatomical structure: A part of a cellular organism consisting of a material entity with granularity above the level of a protein complex but below that of an anatomical system. Note that cellular organisms exclude viruses.
- cellular bud membrane: The portion of the plasma membrane surrounding a cellular bud.
- cellular_component: A location, relative to cellular compartments and structures, occupied by a macromolecular machine. There are three types of cellular components described in the gene ontology: (1) the cellular anatomical entity where a gene product carries out a molecular function (e.g., plasma membrane, cytoskeleton) or membrane-enclosed compartments (e.g., mitochondrion); (2) virion components, where viral proteins act, and (3) the stable macromolecular complexes of which gene product are parts (e.g., the clathrin complex).
- distal portion of axoneme: The portion of the axoneme that is close to the tip of the cilium.
- female germline ring canal outer rim: An electron opaque backbone of the insect ovarian ring canal that is a part of or adjacent to the plasma membrane. The outer rim is established as the cleavage furrow is arrested, and contains F-actin, anillin, glycoproteins and at least one a protein with a high content of phosphorylated tyrosine residues.
- mitotic actomyosin contractile ring, distal actin filament layer: The region of the mitotic actomyosin ring containing actin filaments and cross linkers, myosin motors, and connections to the plasma membrane through the intermediate layer. It is further from the plasma membrane than the intermediate layer which it is adjacent to.
- pairing center: A special chromosome region located towards one end of a chromosome that contains dispersed copies of short, repetitive DNA sequences and functions as a cis-acting element essential for presynaptic homologous chromosome pairing and chromosome-nuclear envelope attachment.
- pericentriolar material: A network of small fibers that surrounds the centrioles in cells; contains the microtubule nucleating activity of the centrosome.
- recurrent axon collateral: Axon collateral that ramifies in the area of the soma of the cell of origin.

- digestive system element: Any of the organs or elements that are part of the digestive system. Examples: tongue, esophagus, spleen, crop, lunge feeding organ, tooth elements.
- duodenal ampulla: The very first part of the duodenum which is slightly dilated.
- duodenum: The first part of the small intestine. At the junction of the stomach and the duodenum the alimentary canal is inflected. The duodenum first goes anteriorly for a short distance, turns dorsally, and eventually caudally, thus it is a U-shaped structure with two horizontal sections (a ventral and a dorsal one).
- esophagus: Tube that connects the pharynx to the stomach. In mammals, the oesophagus connects the buccal cavity with the stomach. The stratified squamous non-keratinised epithelium lining the buccal cavity is continued through the pharynx down into the oesophagus. The lowest part of the oesophagus (ca. 2 cm) is lined with gastric mucosa and covered by peritoneum. The main body of the oesophagus is lined with small, simple mucous glands. Each gland opens into the lumen by a long duct which pierces the muscularis mucosae (Wilson and Washington, 1989). A sphincter is situated at the point where the oesophagus enters the stomach to prevent gastro-oesophageal reflux, i.e. to prevent acidic gastric contents from reaching stratified epithelia of the oesophagus, where they can cause inflammation and irritation (Wilson and Washington, 1989; Brown et al., 1993).
- food storage organ: An organ of the digestive tract that is capable of retaining and storing food.
- foregut region of duodenum
- jejunum: The portion of the small intestine that extends from the duodenum to the ileum.
- lower digestive tract: The region of the digestive tract extending from the beginning of the intestines to the anus[GO - gut definition].
- periampullary region of duodenum
- pyloric stomach: The mouth of a starfish is located on the underside of the body, and opens through a short esophagus into firstly a cardiac stomach, and then, a second, pyloric stomach. Each arm also contains two pyloric caeca, long hollow tubes branching outwards from the pyloric stomach. Each pyloric caecum is lined by a series of digestive glands, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from the food. A short intestine runs from the upper surface of the pyloric stomach to open at an anus in the center of the upper body.
- rectum: The terminal portion of the intestinal tube, terminating with the anus.
- stomach: An expanded region of the vertebrate alimentary tract that serves as a food storage compartment and digestive organ. A stomach is lined, in whole or in part by a glandular epithelium.
- subdivision of digestive tract: A proximal-distal subdivision of the digestive tract.

The execution phase is the last step of an apoptotic process, and is typically characterized by rounding-up of the cell, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), plasma membrane blebbing and fragmentation of the cell into apoptotic bodies. When the execution phase is completed, the cell has died.
- apoptotic process in bone marrow cell: The apoptotic process in cells in the bone marrow.
- compound eye retinal cell apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a compound eye retinal cell.
- fibroblast apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a fibroblast, a connective tissue cell which secretes an extracellular matrix rich in collagen and other macromolecules.
- glial cell apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a glial cell, a non-neuronal cell of the nervous system.
- hippocampal neuron apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process that occurs in a hippocampal neuron.
- inflammatory cell apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in an inflammatory cell, any cell participating in the inflammatory response to a foreign substance e.g. neutrophil, macrophage.
- melanocyte apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a melanocyte, the main structural component of the epidermis.
- mesenchymal cell apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a mesenchymal cell. A mesenchymal cell is a loosely associated cell that is part of the connective tissue in an organism. Mesenchymal cells give rise to more mature connective tissue cell types.
- motor neuron apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a motor neuron, an efferent neuron that passes from the central nervous system or a ganglion toward or to a muscle and conducts an impulse that causes movement.
- muscle cell apoptotic process: A form of programmed cell death induced by external or internal signals that trigger the activity of proteolytic caspases, whose actions dismantle a muscle cell and result in its death. A muscle cell is a mature contractile cell, commonly known as a myocyte, that forms one of three kinds of muscle.
- neuron apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a neuron, the basic cellular unit of nervous tissue. Each neuron consists of a body, an axon, and dendrites. Their purpose is to receive, conduct, and transmit impulses in the nervous system.
- retinal cell apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a retinal cell.
- retinal cone cell apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a retinal cone cell, one of the two photoreceptor cell types of the vertebrate retina.
- retinal rod cell apoptotic process: Any apoptotic process in a retinal rod cell, one of the two photoreceptor cell types of the vertebrate retina.",,"(apoptotic process in bone marrow cell, subClassOf, apoptotic process)

Classes:
- Exclusionary_Right: An exclusionary right concerns the prohibition against performing certain inferences (against reasoning in certain ways), or 
against using certain kinds of premises for certain purposes, in the interest of a particular person. This is especially the case with anti-discrimination rules.
- Liability_Right: A liability right expresses some right to act that brings with it some liability to perform another (compensating) act. For instance, if some k performs the permitted action A, then k will have to perform another action B for the benefit of j.
- Liberty_Right: When, for the benefit of a person, this person is both permitted to perform and to omit an action – that is, when the action is facultative – we can say that he or she has a liberty right with regard to that action.
- Norm: A norm is a kind of Qualification. A qualification which normatively qualifies some thing (i.e. some normatively qualified): i.e. a qualification which allows or disallows some thing.
- Obligation: See prohibition
- Obligative_Right: Directed obligative ought-to-do are also called obligative rights. k has the obligative  right that j does A iff it is obligatory, toward k, that j does A. An example of obligative  right is “it is obligatory, toward Mary, that Tom pays 1,000 euro to John”
- Permission: Permission allows propositions, to which therefore the predication Allowed applies. The thing(s) allowed is/are a subset of the thing(s) qualified by the permission. If S then P(A) means that S is qualified and S and A is allowed.
- Permissive_Right: The  negation of a directed obligation is a directed permission. However, it counts as a right,  namely, a permissive right, only when such negation is aimed at benefitting the author of  the permitted action.
- Prohibition: Prohibition obliges/allows thing(s), to which therefore the predication Obliged applies, and disallows thing(s), to which therefore the predication Disallowed applies. The union of the thing(s) allowed and the thing(s) disallowed is qualified by the prohibition. The things allowed and disallowed by the prohibition are disjoint (and completely partition the space of things qualified). If S then O(A) means that S is qualified, S and A is obliged/allowed, and S and not A is disallowed. If S then F(A) means that S is qualified, S and A is disallowed, and S and not A is obliged/allowed. The difference between Obligation and Prohibition is in which part of the partition of the qualified space is explicitly described by the normative statement. Alternative label: directive

Classes:
- axial mesoderm morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the axial mesoderm are generated and organized.
- dorsal closure, amnioserosa morphology change: The changes that occur during dorsal closure of the shape and structure of the amnioserosa, an epithelium that occupies the dorsal side of the embryo.
- embryonic morphogenesis: The process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized during the embryonic phase. The embryonic phase begins with zygote formation. The end of the embryonic phase is organism-specific. For example, it would be at birth for mammals, larval hatching for insects and seed dormancy in plants.
- fibrous ring of heart morphogenesis: The developmental process by which a fibrous ring of heart is generated and organized.
- intermediate mesoderm morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the intermediate mesoderm are generated and organized.
- lateral mesoderm morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the lateral mesoderm are generated and organized.
- mesoderm morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the mesoderm are generated and organized.
- mesonephric capsule morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the mesonephric capsule are generated and organized. The mesonephric capsule is the tough fibrous layer surrounding the mesonephros, covered in a thick layer of perinephric adipose tissue. It provides some protection from trauma and damage.
- metanephric capsule morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the metanephric capsule are generated and organized. The metanephric capsule is the tough fibrous layer surrounding the metanephros, covered in a thick layer of perinephric adipose tissue. It provides some protection from trauma and damage.
- morphogenesis of an epithelium: The process in which the anatomical structures of epithelia are generated and organized. An epithelium consists of closely packed cells arranged in one or more layers, that covers the outer surfaces of the body or lines any internal cavity or tube.
- muscle tissue morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of muscle tissue are generated and organized. Muscle tissue consists of a set of cells that are part of an organ and carry out a contractive function.
- optic vesicle morphogenesis: The developmental process pertaining to the formation and shaping of the optic vesicle. This process begins with the specific processes that contribute to the appearance of the vesicle and ends when the vesicle has evaginated. The optic vesicle is the evagination of neurectoderm that precedes formation of the optic cup.
- paraxial mesoderm morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the paraxial mesoderm are generated and organized.
- renal capsule morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the renal capsule are generated and organized. The renal capsule is the tough fibrous layer surrounding the kidney, covered in a thick layer of perinephric adipose tissue. It provides some protection from trauma and damage. During development, it comprises a single layer of flattened cells that lie just above the cortical stroma and the condensed mesenchyme of the nephrogenic zone. It is in this region that the early stages of nephron induction and formation of new generations ureteric bud branches occur, as the kidney expands.

Classes:
- anti-LGBTQ bias: Bias against LGBTQIA+ people based on their identities, namely sexual orientation identity and gender identity.
- attitude: A psychological construct, a mental and emotional entity that inheres in, or characterizes a person. They are complex and are an acquired state through experiences. It is an individual's predisposed state of mind regarding a value[disambiguation needed] and it is precipitated through a responsive expression towards a person, place, thing, or event (the attitude object) which in turn influences the individual's thought and action.
- bias: Bias is disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing, usually in a way that is closed-minded, prejudicial, or unfair. Biases can be innate or learned. People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief.
- cognitive bias: A systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Individuals create their own ""subjective social reality"" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of social reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behaviour in the social world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.
- contextual bias: Biases which occur when a person is influenced by extraneous information.
- cultural bias: The phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture.
- ethnic bias: Bias against one based on their ethnicity.
- gender bias: Bias against one based on their gender.
- gender-related stereotype: Stereotypes related to a person's gender.
- lesbian stereotype: Conventional, formulaic generalizations, opinions, or images based on people who are lesbians.
- male stereotype: Conventional, formulaic generalizations, opinions, or images concerning men.
- physical-appearance-based bias: Bias against one based on their physical appearance.
- race bias: Bias against one based on their race.
- statistical bias: A feature of a statistical technique or of its results whereby the expected value of the results differs from the true underlying quantitative parameter being estimated. The bias of an estimator of a parameter should not be confused with its degree of precision as the degree of precision is a measure of the sampling error.
- stereotype bias: An over-generalized belief about a particular category of people. It is an expectation that people might have about every person of a particular group. The type of expectation can vary; it can be, for example, an expectation about the group's personality, preferences, or ability.",,"(anti-LGBTQ bias, subClassOf, cultural bias)

- CD34 molecule: A protein that is a translation product of the human CD34 gene or a 1:1 ortholog thereof. It is a leukocyte membrane protein expressed specifically by lymphohematopoietic progenitor cells. It contains a single-pass transmembrane domain and that show distinct expression on early hematopoietic precursors and vascular-associated tissue. Acts as a scaffold that presents selectin carbohydrate ligands in a clustered, tissue specific manner to allow for higher avidity interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells during the inflammatory process. In common with related sialomucins (endoglycan and podocalyxin), the extracellular region is dominated by an N-terminal mucin-like domain, which is densely substituted with sialylated O-linked carbohydrates. The mucin-like region is followed by a cysteine-containing and presumably globular domain. This domain may fold into an immunoglobulin-like structure as the positions of 2 of the cysteines are conserved in the C2 set of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The cytoplasmic domain is around 73-76 residues long and highly conserved.

	Gateway, and Sequence Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN 
	Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Graphical element: These are the elements that define the 
	basic look-and-feel of BPMN. Most business processes will be modeled 
	adequately with these elements
- Group: A grouping of activities that does not affect the 
	Sequence Flow. The grouping can be used for documentation or analysis 
	purposes. Groups can also be used to identify the activities of a
	distributed transaction that is shown across Pools.
- Lane: A Lane is a sub-partition within a Pool and will extend 
	the entire length of the Pool, either vertically or horizontally. Lanes 
	are used to organize and categorize activities.
- Message: Message, which is used in the definition of attributes
	for a Start Event, End Event, Intermediate Event, Task, and Message 
	Flow, and which extends the set of common BPMN Element attributes (see 
	Table B.2)
- Participant: Participant, which is used in the definition of 
	attributes for a Pool, Message, and Web service, and which extends the 
	set of common BPMN Element attributes (see Table B.2).
- Pool: A Pool represents a Participant in a Process. It is
                      also acts as a ""swimlane"" and a graphical container
                      for partitioning a set of activities from other Pools,
                      usually in the context of B2B situations.
- Process: A Process is an activity performed within or across 
	companies or organizations. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of 
	Flow Objects, which are a set of other activities and the controls that
	sequence them. The concept of process is intrinsically hierarchical. 
	Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide processes to
	processes performed by a single person. Low-level processes may be
	grouped together to achieve a common business goal. Note that BPMN 
	defines the term Process fairly specifically and defines a Business 
	Process more generically as a set of activities that are performed 
	within an organization or across organizations. Thus a Business Process,
	as shown in a Business Process Diagram, may contain more than one 
	separate Process. Each Process may have its own Sub-Processes and would
	be contained within a Pool (Section B.8.2, on page 260). The individual
	Processes would be independent in terms of Sequence Flow, but could have
	Message Flow connecting them.

- Role: Role, which is used in the definition of attributes for 
	a Participant, and which extends the set of common BPMN Element 
	attributes (see Table B.2).

Classes:
- Abstract_Entity: An abstract concept is a concept which does not (necessarily) have a referent in either the physical or the mental world.   

Abstract entities are (proto)mathematical, formal entities, entities which have a purely formal, logical or mathematical meaning.

As all concepts are abstractions, one may argue that a separate abstract world is difficult to see. In common-sense, a circle has more properties and is less abstract than in mathematics. Even mathematicians marvel about the fact their pure abstractions enable us to predict very concrete things. However, we are not directly concerned with these mappings. The most important is that common-sense knows about a (small) number of proto-mathematical concepts, such as collections, sequences and count-numbers (positive integers). We know also about geometric simplifications such as line, circle, square, cube, etc. These common sense notions might even be the real roots of our mathematics. However, these kind of semi-formal abstractions do not play a very central role in law, and therefore LRI-Core is thinly populated with abstract classes.
- Application_Date: The date when a modification is applied to the destination legislative document. The date can be instantaneous, in the future or in the past. Normally this date coincides with the date of efficacy of the text in which the modification takes place.
- Atom: An atom has no parts
- Composition: A composition has multiple parts, the components should meet
- Delivery_Date: The date when the competent authorities finalise the document by affixing their signatures to it (e.g. promulgation by the president, signature by the queen etc.) This is the date shown on the document itself: it is an objective element and clearly identifyable.
- Efficacy_Interval: The period during which a normative fragment may be either operative or inoperative, by explicit provision of the document itself. The document is said to be in a period of operation, or enforceability or efficacy, when it may or must be applied or enforced.
- Enter_in_Force_Date: The date when a dnormative document becomes law and enters the legal system for the first time. This is the moment in the doucment's history starting from which the document can be amended, its applicability assessed, and its manner of producing an effect determined.
- Existence_Date: The date when the formal act by which a legislative body freezes the document into its final form, it is the time when the document can be said to have begun its existence.
- Interval: An interval is a composition of multiple periods of time.
- Moment: A moment is an atomic period of time, i.e. it cannot be divided into other parts
- Pair: A composition of exactly two parts
- Part: A part is a part_of some whole

The thalamus represents the major portion of the diencephalon and is commonly divided into cellular aggregates known as nuclear groups.(MeSH). The dorsal topographic division of the interbrain. The macrodissected adult human thalamus was clearly illustrated by Vesalius in 1543 and the term as defined here was introduced by His in 1893. It includes the traditional epithalamus, dorsal thalamus, and ventral thalamus of Herrick (1910, pp. 494, 498). Also see Kuhlenbeck (1927, Ch. 9) and Jones (1985, p. 87).

Classes:
- Agent: An agent is any owl:Thing which can act, i.e. play the 'actor' role wrt. an action
- Assertion: The assertion is subject to a fit between words and world, in Searle's terms. It's propositional content can be true of false. If it is inconsistent with other assertions, beliefs, observations, it may come to be considered false.
- Belief: Someting an agent 'believes in', i.e. holds as true
- Belief_In_Violation: A belief in some violation
- Communicated_Attitude: A communictated attitude is a propositional attitude involved in an act of communication.
- Declaration: Searle: the successful performance of a declaration is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true. In other words, if there is an inconsistency between the declaration and assertions, beliefs, or observations, it is not the declaration that is false. True of definitions and norms, and several other performative statements by legislators.
- Desire: A feeling of wanting
- Evaluative_Attitude: An evaluative attitude expresses e.g. a judgment. The proposition qualified by the evaluative attitude is comparable to something else.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Intention
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Plan: A plan is a structure of multiple other plans or actions. These can be both sequential or concurrent. Usually a plan is referred to in the context of the intention to act of some agent, however when executed the plan itself comes into effect.
- Promise: A promise is a communicated attitude about some future action or state
- Propositional_Attitude: A propositional attitude connects a person (the holder of the attitude) to some proposition, in fact it expresses some qualification over the proposition. Distinguishing a proposition from the propositional content expressed by it is necessary when properties relating to the thing expressed and properties of the expression itself must be distinguished. For LKIF the distinction between Belief, Intention, Qualification, and Observation is relevant. The distinction between belief/expectation, intention, and observation is relevant for i.a. establishing mens rea (guilty mind). The distinction between beliefs (expressing the content of the mind of an agent) and statements (expressing the content of an act of communication by an agent) is classical.

Classes:
- Abstract_Entity: An abstract concept is a concept which does not (necessarily) have a referent in either the physical or the mental world.   

Abstract entities are (proto)mathematical, formal entities, entities which have a purely formal, logical or mathematical meaning.

As all concepts are abstractions, one may argue that a separate abstract world is difficult to see. In common-sense, a circle has more properties and is less abstract than in mathematics. Even mathematicians marvel about the fact their pure abstractions enable us to predict very concrete things. However, we are not directly concerned with these mappings. The most important is that common-sense knows about a (small) number of proto-mathematical concepts, such as collections, sequences and count-numbers (positive integers). We know also about geometric simplifications such as line, circle, square, cube, etc. These common sense notions might even be the real roots of our mathematics. However, these kind of semi-formal abstractions do not play a very central role in law, and therefore LRI-Core is thinly populated with abstract classes.
- Artifact: A physical object created by some person to fulfill a particular purpose
- Collaborative_Plan: A collaborative plan is a plan which is shared (and executed) between at least two agents a and b.
- Mental_Entity
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Mental_Process: A mental, i.e. non-physical, process that has no physical effects. Examples are (human) thought and reasoning.
- Natural_Object: A natural object is an object not created by man.
- Occurrence: A consequence of our clear separation of ontology from models of situations (occurrences), is well exemplified in the two ways we look at time and space. Things happen against the canvas of space and time. This 3D canvas moving in time (or whatever metaphor) allows us to index instances of objects and processes. Time and space provide positions in time and space for objects. Positions are in general modeled in some mereological framework. However, the objects and processes as classes have time and space properties in a different way. Space occupied by an object is its inherent property of size or extension. This property was for Descartes even the critical one that separated mental (not: abstract) objects from physical ones. Processes occupy (consume) time; they take some duration. This time resource is inversely related to the consumption of energy. This distinction between position and extension is also made in various other ontologies. However, this distinction is easily obscured by the fact that the extension of an object can also be used as a reference for location. An object can be in another object. In fact, any physical object can be used as a spatial and even temporal referent. This does not refute our view that locations are occurrences. To be precise: extension is an inherent, necessary property of a physical object or process; its location is an accidental one.
- Physical_Entity
- Physical_Object: A physical object is a physical entity consisting of matter, it has a spatio-temporal extension.
- Physical_Process
- Plan: A plan is a structure of multiple other plans or actions. These can be both sequential or concurrent. Usually a plan is referred to in the context of the intention to act of some agent, however when executed the plan itself comes into effect.
- Process: A process is a 'causal' change: any change which can be explained through some known or understood causal structure. Every process has some Time_Period as duration.
- Spatio_Temporal_Occurrence: An occurrence in space-time
- Subjective_Entity: A subjective entity is ontologically subjective, i.e. its existence is relative to an observer, that attributes its properties to some other entity, given a context.",,"(Artifact, subClassOf, Physical_Object)

Classes:
- cyberbullying: The use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person.
- doxing: The Internet-based practice of researching and publicly broadcasting private or identifying information (especially personally identifying information) about an individual or organization. The methods employed to acquire this information include searching publicly available databases and social media websites (like Facebook), hacking, and social engineering. It is closely related to Internet vigilantism and hacktivism.
- gross misconduct: Misconduct severe enough to have the ability to lead to dismissal from a particular position; misconduct that is possibly criminal in nature (such as stealing or sexual harassment).
- judicial misconduct: Narrowly, misconduct which occurs when a judge acts in ways that are considered unethical or otherwise violate the judge's obligations of impartial conduct; broadly, any kind of misconduct associated with any part of the legal process or to the administration of justice.
- official misconduct: The commission of an unlawful act, done in an official capacity, that affects the performance of official duties.
- online harassment: A form of harassment using electronic means.
- online misconduct: Misconduct which takes place online, usually (but not always) on the internet.
- police misconduct: Inappropriate conduct and/or illegal actions taken by police officers in connection with their official duties.
- professional misconduct: Violation of laws, regulations, or professional standards.
- sexual harassment: Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from mild transgressions to sexual abuse or sexual assault.
- sexual misconduct: Any misconduct of a sexual nature that is of lesser offense than felony sexual assault (such as rape and molestation), particularly where the situation is normally non-sexual and therefore unusual for sexual behavior, or where there is some aspect of personal power or authority that makes sexual behavior inappropriate.
- social behavior: Behavior directed towards society, or taking place between members of the same species. Occurs predominantly, or only, in individuals that are part of a group. Behavior such as predation which involves members of different species is not social. Communication between members of different species is also not social behavior.
- uncivil behavior: Social behavior deemed as lacking in civility.
- witness tampering: The act of attempting to improperly influence, alter or prevent the testimony of witnesses within criminal or civil proceedings.

Classes:
- Agent: An agent is any owl:Thing which can act, i.e. play the 'actor' role wrt. an action
- Assertion: The assertion is subject to a fit between words and world, in Searle's terms. It's propositional content can be true of false. If it is inconsistent with other assertions, beliefs, observations, it may come to be considered false.
- Belief: Someting an agent 'believes in', i.e. holds as true
- Communicated_Attitude: A communictated attitude is a propositional attitude involved in an act of communication.
- Declaration: Searle: the successful performance of a declaration is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true. In other words, if there is an inconsistency between the declaration and assertions, beliefs, or observations, it is not the declaration that is false. True of definitions and norms, and several other performative statements by legislators.
- Desire: A feeling of wanting
- Disallowed_Intention: The propositional content (i.e. that which is intended) of the intention is disallowed. Interesting concept for establishing mens rea (guilty mind), although 'disallowed' is a weaker qualification than criminal. Note the distinction between purposely committing a crime and knowingly committing a crime. The crime committed does not have to match the crime intended for establishing intent!
- Evaluative_Attitude: An evaluative attitude expresses e.g. a judgment. The proposition qualified by the evaluative attitude is comparable to something else.
- Evaluative_Proposition: Some thing which is evaluatively qualified, i.e. an evaluation applies to the proposition, the proposition is judged. The proposition is comparable to some other proposition.
- Expression: An expression is a proposition beared by some medium, e.g. a document, and is stated by some communicated attitude
- Intention
- Mental_Object: Metaphor of physical concepts, i.e. the things we mentally manipulate, either in thought or memory
- Proposition: A (non logical) proposition is a proposition qualified by a propositional attitude. NB: The proposition used here does not correspond to a proposition in proposition logics.
- Propositional_Attitude: A propositional attitude connects a person (the holder of the attitude) to some proposition, in fact it expresses some qualification over the proposition. Distinguishing a proposition from the propositional content expressed by it is necessary when properties relating to the thing expressed and properties of the expression itself must be distinguished. For LKIF the distinction between Belief, Intention, Qualification, and Observation is relevant. The distinction between belief/expectation, intention, and observation is relevant for i.a. establishing mens rea (guilty mind). The distinction between beliefs (expressing the content of the mind of an agent) and statements (expressing the content of an act of communication by an agent) is classical.

Classes:
- Argument: An argument is some rule used in argumentation (cf. Deliverable 1.1)
- Assumption: An assumption is some atom held to be true, without proof, in the head of a rule (defeasibly), cf. Deliverable 1.1
- Assumption: proposes something that usually is the case, although there is no specific evidence that it is true in this particular case
- Atom: An atom is the most basic (undivisible) part of an LKIF rule (cf. Deliverable 1.1)
- Cause: A cause is an epistemic role played by something which is the outcome of a (chain) of processes
- Epistemic_Role: The role of something used in a (mental) reasoning/inference process
- Exception: An exception states an exception to the head of the rule (defeasibly), cf. Deliverable 1.1
- Exception: An exception is something that is excluded from a general statement or does not follow a rule. In LKIF rules, an exception is a rule which has an exception relation to another rule (cf. Deliverable 1.1)
- Expectation: An expectation is a predictive belief held on purely logical grounds, i.e. not based on direct external evidence, like an observation or a statement by another agent. It is also often characterized as a ""belief about the future"", but this isn't very helpful since one may also hold expectations about the (yet unknown) past. The theory of evolution is for instance a fertile ground for predictions about the existence of past species, and therefore at the same a predictor of future observations.
- Negated_Atom: A negated atom is the negation of some other atom (cf. Deliverable 1.1)
- Observation: An observation is the role played by some proposition believed to be true or false through observation of an agent.
- Reason: Teleological counterpart of cause
- Role: A role is a specification of default behavior and accompanying expectations of the thing 'playing' the role. Similar to actors in a theater who play roles, but are not the roles. Example: student.

- carbohydrate: Any member of the class of organooxygen compounds that is a polyhydroxy-aldehyde or -ketone or a lactol resulting from their intramolecular condensation (monosaccharides); substances derived from these by reduction of the carbonyl group (alditols), by oxidation of one or more hydroxy groups to afford the corresponding aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids, or by replacement of one or more hydroxy group(s) by a hydrogen atom; and polymeric products arising by intermolecular acetal formation between two or more such molecules (disaccharides, polysaccharides and oligosaccharides). Carbohydrates contain only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms; prior to any oxidation or reduction, most have the empirical formula Cm(H2O)n. Compounds obtained from carbohydrates by substitution, etc., are known as carbohydrate derivatives and may contain other elements. Cyclitols are generally not regarded as carbohydrates.
- carbohydrate derivative: Any organooxygen compound derived from a carbohydrate by replacement of one or more hydroxy group(s) by an amino group, a thiol group or similar heteroatomic groups. The term also includes derivatives of these compounds.
- carbohydrates and carbohydrate derivatives: Any organooxygen compound that is a polyhydroxy-aldehyde or -ketone, or a compound derived from one. Carbohydrates contain only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and usually have an empirical formula Cm(H2O)n; carbohydrate derivatives may contain other elements by substitution or condensation.
- glycan: Any oligosaccharide, polysaccharide or their derivatives consisting of monosaccharides or monosaccharide derivatives linked by glycosidic bonds. See also http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/GNO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GNO_00000001.

Classes:
- DIY gender transition: Do-it-yourself gender transition typically undertaken as a result of extreme gatekeeping of gender transition procedures and/or processes.
- gender affirmation: The process through which individuals are affirmed in their gender identity through social interactions.
- gender assignment: The determination of an infant's gender shortly after birth.
- gender disaffirmation: The process through which individuals are disaffirmed in their gender identity, under the assumption that that identity is pathological in nature.
- gender process: The formation, practice, evolution, and representation of notions associated with gender.
- gender retransition: Transitioning after stopping gender transition for any reason.
- gender socialization: The learning of behavior and attitudes considered appropriate for a given societal gender role. The behavior that is seen to be appropriate for each gender is largely determined by societal, cultural and economic values in a given society. Gender socialization can therefore vary considerably among societies with different values.
- gender transition: The process of changing one's gender presentation and/or sex characteristics to accord with one's internal sense of gender identity.
- group assignment: Group assignment is a process which has an organism as specified input and during which a role is assigned.
- process: p is a process = Def. p is an occurrent that has temporal proper parts and for some time t, p s-depends_on some material entity at t. (axiom label in BFO2 Reference: [083-003])
- social behavior: Behavior directed towards society, or taking place between members of the same species. Occurs predominantly, or only, in individuals that are part of a group. Behavior such as predation which involves members of different species is not social. Communication between members of different species is also not social behavior.
- social gender transition: The social portion of gender transition during which others are made aware of a person's gender identity. Other parts of social transition include wearing the clothing matching one's gender identity or learning particular gender norm's associated with said identity.
- social interaction: An interaction between two or more individuals or populations in a society. Social interaction is a building block of society.
- social process: A recurrent and patterned process that involves the interactions or responses of individuals to one another which have attained stability.
- socialization: The process of internalizing the norms and ideologies of society.",,"(DIY gender transition, subClassOf, gender transition)

In the popliteal fossa the nerve gives off branches to gastrocnemius, popliteus, soleus and plantaris muscles, an articular branch to the knee joint, and a cutaneous branch that will become the sural nerve. The sural nerve is joined by fibres from the common peroneal nerve and runs down the calf to supply the lateral side of the foot. Below the soleus muscle the nerve lies close to the tibia and supplies the tibialis posterior, the flexor digitorum longus and the flexor hallucis longus. The nerve passes into the foot running posterior to the medial malleolus. Here it is bound down by the flexor retinaculum in company with the posterior tibial artery. [WP,unvetted].

Classes:
- Absolute_Place: An absolute place is defined without reference to other places.
- Comprehensive_Place: A place is comprehensive if it always covers every place (and thus also every location-complex) and every object.
- Delivery_Date: The date when the competent authorities finalise the document by affixing their signatures to it (e.g. promulgation by the president, signature by the queen etc.) This is the date shown on the document itself: it is an objective element and clearly identifyable.
- Dynamic_Temporal_Entity: A dynamic temporal entity represents the norm in its evolution over time.
- Enter_in_Force_Date: The date when a dnormative document becomes law and enters the legal system for the first time. This is the moment in the doucment's history starting from which the document can be amended, its applicability assessed, and its manner of producing an effect determined.
- Interval: An interval is a composition of multiple periods of time.
- Location_Complex: A location complex is a relatively stable complex of places referred to as one: it is the maximal collection of places with the same reference object.
- Occurrence: A consequence of our clear separation of ontology from models of situations (occurrences), is well exemplified in the two ways we look at time and space. Things happen against the canvas of space and time. This 3D canvas moving in time (or whatever metaphor) allows us to index instances of objects and processes. Time and space provide positions in time and space for objects. Positions are in general modeled in some mereological framework. However, the objects and processes as classes have time and space properties in a different way. Space occupied by an object is its inherent property of size or extension. This property was for Descartes even the critical one that separated mental (not: abstract) objects from physical ones. Processes occupy (consume) time; they take some duration. This time resource is inversely related to the consumption of energy. This distinction between position and extension is also made in various other ontologies. However, this distinction is easily obscured by the fact that the extension of an object can also be used as a reference for location. An object can be in another object. In fact, any physical object can be used as a spatial and even temporal referent. This does not refute our view that locations are occurrences. To be precise: extension is an inherent, necessary property of a physical object or process; its location is an accidental one.
- Place: A place is a spatio-temporal-occurrence
- Publication_Date: The date when the normative document is published in the official journal designated as the source for making all such documents public and legal.
- Relative_Place: A relative place is defined by some reference to some object/thing

Classes:
- COPII vesicle coating: The addition of COPII proteins and adaptor proteins to ER membranes during the formation of transport vesicles, forming a vesicle coat.
- Cvt vesicle assembly: A vesicle organization process that takes place as part of the Cvt pathway, and results in the formation of a double membrane-bounded cytosolic structure that sequesters precursor aminopeptidase I (prAPI).
- Golgi transport vesicle coating: The addition of specific coat proteins to Golgi membranes during the formation of transport vesicles.
- acrosome assembly: The formation of the acrosome from the spermatid Golgi.
- ciliary vesicle assembly: The aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form a ciliary vesicle. Multiple smaller vesicles dock to the transitional fibers on a mature basal body and then fuse together to form a larger single vesicle. This then fuses with the plasma membrane and forms the ciliary membrane.
- extracellular exosome assembly: The aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form an extracellular vesicular exosome, a membrane-bounded vesicle that is released into the extracellular region by fusion of the limiting endosomal membrane of a multivesicular body with the plasma membrane. Exosomes are defined by their size, which generally ranges from 30 nm to 100 nm.
- organelle assembly: The aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form an organelle. An organelle is an organized structure of distinctive morphology and function. Includes the nucleus, mitochondria, plastids, vacuoles, vesicles, ribosomes and the cytoskeleton. Excludes the plasma membrane.
- organelle organization: A process that is carried out at the cellular level which results in the assembly, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of an organelle within a cell. An organelle is an organized structure of distinctive morphology and function. Includes the nucleus, mitochondria, plastids, vacuoles, vesicles, ribosomes and the cytoskeleton. Excludes the plasma membrane.
- phagolysosome assembly: The process that results in the fusion of a phagosome, a vesicle formed by phagocytosis, with a lysosome.
- pigment granule organization: A process that is carried out at the cellular level which results in the assembly, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of a pigment granule.
- secretory granule organization: A process that is carried out at the cellular level which results in the assembly, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of a secretory granule. A secretory granule is a small subcellular vesicle, surrounded by a membrane, that is formed from the Golgi apparatus and contains a highly concentrated protein destined for secretion.
- synaptic vesicle coating: The formation of clathrin coated pits in the presynaptic membrane endocytic zone, triggered by the presence of high concentrations of synaptic vesicle components. This process leads to, but does not include budding of the membrane to form new vesicles.
- synaptic vesicle maturation: Steps required to form an initiated synaptic vesicle into a fully formed and transmissible synaptic vesicle.
- vesicle coating: A protein coat is added to the vesicle to form the proper shape of the vesicle and to target the vesicle for transport to its destination.

Classes:
- Aesthetic movement: An intellectual and art movement supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values more than social-political themes for literature, fine art, music and other arts. This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning — ""art for art's sake"". It was particularly prominent in England during the late 19th century, supported by notable figures such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde.
- Decadent movement: A late-19th-century artistic and literary movement, centered in Western Europe, that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality.
- LGBTQ rights movement: LGBTQ movements advocating for civil and/or human rights.
- Transmodernist movement: A philosophical and cultural movement which was founded by Argentinian-Mexican philosopher Enrique Dussel. Transmodernism is a development in thought following the period of postmodernism; as a movement, it was also developed from modernism, and, in turn, critiques modernity and postmodernity, viewing them as the end of modernism.
- abolitionist movement: Any of various movements to end slavery in any of its various forms. Usually used to apply to the end of the Atlantic slave trade and ending slavery in Western Europe and the Americas. However, it may also refer to historical movements attempting to end ""white slavery"", i.e. the sexual enslavement of white women.
- art movement: An art movement is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years.
- health movement: A social movement focused around any of various aspects of health or health-related issues.
- human rights movement: Any of various non-governmental social movement engaged in activism related to the issues of human rights. The foundations of the global human rights movement involve resistance to: colonialism, imperialism, slavery, racism, segregation, patriarchy, and oppression of Indigenous peoples.
- philosophical movement: An appearance or increased popularity of a specific school of philosophy.
- police abolitionist movement: A political movement that advocates replacing policing with other systems of public safety. Police abolitionists believe that policing, as a system, is inherently flawed and cannot be reformed—a view that rejects the ideology of police reformists. While reformists seek to address the ways in which policing occurs, abolitionists seek to transform policing altogether through a process of disbanding, disempowering, and disarming the police. Abolitionists argue that the institution of policing is deeply rooted in a history of white supremacy and settler colonialism and that it is inseparable from a pre-existing racial capitalist order, and thus believe a reformist approach to policing will always fail.
- political movement: A collective attempt by a group of people to change government policy or social values. Political movements are usually in opposition to an element of the status quo and are often associated with a certain ideology.
- prison abolitionist movement: An abolitionist movement which seeks to reduce or eliminate prisons and the prison system, and replace them with systems of rehabilitation that do not place a focus on punishment and government institutionalization.
- reproductive rights movement: Any of various human rights movements which advocate for reproductive rights.
- sex work abolitionist movement: A movement which became prominent in the late 19th century, via the International Abolitionist Federation (IAF), which aimed to abolish state regulation of sex work and fought the international trafficking of women in prostitution and sexual slavery.
- social movement: A social movement is a type of group action. There is no single consensus definition of a social movement. They are large, sometimes informal, groupings of individuals or organizations which focus on specific political or social issues. In other words, they carry out, resist, or undo a social change. They provide a way of social change from the bottom within nations.",,"(Aesthetic movement, subClassOf, art movement)

Classes:
- Expression: The intellectual realisation of a Work in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as, but not limited to, text.

For example, any electronic or physical format of the legal expression (XML, TIFF, PDF, etc.) ; e.g. PDF version of act 3 of 2005.  (adapted from Akoma Ntoso).
Note that the notion of Format in ELI is more precise than a FRBR Manifestation in the sense that a Format in ELI can carry a legal value (see the property eli:legal_value).
- Format type: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme eli:MediaTypeTable.
- Language: Formally defined as the set of skos:Concept in concept scheme http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/language
- Legal Expression: The intellectual realisation of a legal resource in the form of a ""sequence of signs"" (typically alpha-numeric characters in a legal context).
For example, any version of the legal resource whose content is specified and different from others for any reason: language, versions, etc.;

Note that ELI ontology accommodates different point of view on what should be considered a new legal resource, or a new legal expression of the same resource. Typically, a consolidated version can be viewed, in the context of ELI, either as separate legal resource (linked to original version and previous consolidated version using corresponding ELI relations), or as a different legal expression of the same legal resource.
- Manifestation: The physical embodiment of an Expression, either on paper or in any electronic format.

The substance of Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.

Classes:
- Assumption: proposes something that usually is the case, although there is no specific evidence that it is true in this particular case
- Cause: A cause is an epistemic role played by something which is the outcome of a (chain) of processes
- Epistemic_Role: The role of something used in a (mental) reasoning/inference process
- Evidence: Observation and/or statement, used as a backing for a belief. Evidence is the role of observation which is qualified by some belief.
- Exception: An exception is something that is excluded from a general statement or does not follow a rule. In LKIF rules, an exception is a rule which has an exception relation to another rule (cf. Deliverable 1.1)
- Expectation: An expectation is a predictive belief held on purely logical grounds, i.e. not based on direct external evidence, like an observation or a statement by another agent. It is also often characterized as a ""belief about the future"", but this isn't very helpful since one may also hold expectations about the (yet unknown) past. The theory of evolution is for instance a fertile ground for predictions about the existence of past species, and therefore at the same a predictor of future observations.
- Fact: A fact is a proposition (about something) which is (commonly) agreed upon to hold as true: it has some backing in evidence
- Function: The use or purpose of some object as used in some context.
- Observation: An observation is the role played by some proposition believed to be true or false through observation of an agent.
- Problem: A problem is an observation that deviates from an Intention.
- Reason: Teleological counterpart of cause
- Role: A role is a specification of default behavior and accompanying expectations of the thing 'playing' the role. Similar to actors in a theater who play roles, but are not the roles. Example: student.
- Social_Role: A social role is played by some agent in the context of social activities. The social role brings with it some expectation of 'default' behavior of the role-filler.
- Subjective_Entity: A subjective entity is ontologically subjective, i.e. its existence is relative to an observer, that attributes its properties to some other entity, given a context.

- lexical class: Any of various classes of lexical items or units (such as words or phrases).
- linguistic class: Any of various classes of linguistic items or items related to language.
- linguistic set: Linguistic entity which consists of a maximum number of some instances of discontinuous members of the same class.
- noun: A word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things, such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas.
- open word class: A word class that commonly accepts the addition of new words.
- part of speech: A category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) that have similar grammatical properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar syntactic behavior—they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences—and sometimes similar morphology in that they undergo inflection for similar properties.
- pro-form: A type of function word or expression that stands in for (expresses the same content as) another word, phrase, clause or sentence where the meaning is recoverable from the context. They are used either to avoid repetitive expressions or in quantification (limiting the variables of a proposition).
- pronoun set: A set of pronouns, usually indicated for use for an individual.
- set: A set is a collection of entities, for which there may be zero members.
- syntactic class: A type of syntactic unit that theories of syntax assume. Word classes, largely corresponding to traditional parts of speech (e.g. noun, verb, preposition, etc.), are syntactic categories.

Classes:
- distal tubule development: The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the distal tubule over time, from its formation to the mature structure. In mammals, the distal tubule is a nephron tubule that begins at the macula densa and extends to the connecting tubule.
- metanephric connecting tubule development: The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the metanephric connecting tubule over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The metanephric connecting tubule is a tubular segment of the metanephric nephron; it connects the distal convoluted tubule to the collecting duct in the metanephros.
- metanephric distal convoluted tubule development: The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the metanephric distal convoluted tubule over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The metanephric distal convoluted tubule is the first segment of the metanephric nephron lying just downstream from the loop of Henle, immediately after the macula densa. Among other functions, in humans it is responsible for the reabsorption of about 5% of filtered sodium via the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl symporter.

- Custom: The collective memory of some group of agents, i.e. propositions beared by custom are shared (i.e. held) by all members of the group
- Customary_Law: In law, custom, or customary law consists of established patterns of behaviour that can be objectively verified within a particular social setting.
- Decree: The word decree is often used as a derogative term for any authoritarian decision
- Directive: Examples are European Union directive, a legislative act of the European Union and Directives, used by United States Government agencies (particularly the Department of Defense) to convey policies, responsibilities, and procedures.
- International_Agreement: An agreement entered into by actors in international law, namely states and international organizations.
- Legal_Doctrine: Legal doctrine is a framework, set of rules, procedural steps, or test, often established through precedent in the common law, through which judgments can be determined in a given legal cas
- Legal_Document: A legal document is a document bearing norms or normative statements. By virtue of this definition the norm-as-propositional-attitude is reified as norm-as proposition. In other words, the norm being expressed through the legal source is an expression of the propositional attitude.
- Legal_Source: A legal source is a source for legal statements, both norms and legal expressions. In a sense it is literally a 'source' of law
- Mandatory_Precedent: In law, a binding precedent (also mandatory precedent or binding authority) is a precedent which must be followed by all lower courts. It is usually created by the decision of a higher court, such as the House of Lords in the United Kingdom. Binding precedent relies on the legal principle of stare decisis.
- Medium
- Persuasive_Precedent: In law, a persuasive precedent or advisory precedent is a precedent that need not be followed under the legal principle of stare decisis, but is nevertheless followed. Sources of persuasive precedent include the obiter dicta in the judgment of a court whose judgment would otherwise be binding, and the judgments of courts in other jurisdictions where the facts and/or legal system are similar to the case at hand. If a superior court adopts a persuasive precedent, it may become binding in the jurisdiction.
- Precedent: In law, a precedent or authority is a legal case establishing a principle or rule that a court may need to adopt when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts. The term may also refer to the collective body of case law that a court should consider when interpreting the law. When a precedent establishes an important legal principle, or represents new or changed law on a particular issue, that precedent is often known as a landmark decision.
- Proclamation: A proclamation (Lat. proclamare, to make public by announcement) is an official declaration.
- Resolution: A resolution is a written motion adopted by a deliberative body. The substance of the resolution can be anything that can normally be proposed as a motion.
- Soft_Law: The term ""soft law"" refers to quasi-legal instruments which do not have any binding force, or whose binding force is somewhat ""weaker"" than the binding force of traditional law, often referred to as ""hard law"", in this context. The term ""soft law"" initially appeared in the area of international law, but more recently it has been transferred to other branches of law.",,"(Custom, subClassOf, Medium)

Historically, many cultures considered adultery a very serious crime, some subject to severe punishment, especially in the case of extramarital sex involving a married woman and a man other than her husband, with penalties including capital punishment, mutilation, or torture. Such punishments have gradually fallen into disfavor, especially in Anglosphere and European countries from the 19th century. In countries where adultery is still a criminal offense, punishments range from fines to caning and even capital punishment. Since the 20th century, criminal laws against adultery have become controversial, with most countries repealing them.

The term host is used for the larger (macro) of the two members of a symbiosis; the various forms of symbiosis include parasitism, commensalism and mutualism.
- biological process involved in interaction with symbiont: An interaction between two organisms living together in more or less intimate association. The term symbiont is used for the smaller (macro) of the two members of a symbiosis; the various forms of symbiosis include parasitism, commensalism and mutualism.
- biological process involved in interspecies interaction between organisms: Any process evolved to enable an interaction with an organism of a different species.
- biological process involved in symbiotic interaction: A process carried out by gene products in an organism that enable the organism to engage in a symbiotic relationship, a more or less intimate association, with another organism. The various forms of symbiosis include parasitism, in which the association is disadvantageous or destructive to one of the organisms; mutualism, in which the association is advantageous, or often necessary to one or both and not harmful to either; and commensalism, in which one member of the association benefits while the other is not affected. However, mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism are often not discrete categories of interactions and should rather be perceived as a continuum of interaction ranging from parasitism to mutualism. In fact, the direction of a symbiotic interaction can change during the lifetime of the symbionts due to developmental changes as well as changes in the biotic/abiotic environment in which the interaction occurs. Microscopic symbionts are often referred to as endosymbionts.
- glucosinolate transport: The directed movement of a glucosinolate into, out of or within a cell, or between cells, by means of some agent such as a transporter or pore.
- obsolete chromatin insulator sequence binding: OBSOLETE. (Was not defined before being made obsolete).
- symbiont-mediated evasion of DNA end degradation by host: A process by which a symbiont evades and ends degradation of its DNA when free DNA ends are exposed. DNA ends are exposed during the life cycle of some viruses and these are targeted by host cells to destroy the virus. For example, some bacteriophages encode proteins that bind to free viral DNA ends, protecting them from degradation by host exonucleases.
- symbiont-mediated evasion of host innate immune response: A process by which a symbiont avoids recognition by host's innate immune response by altering, concealing or destroying a conserved symbiont molecule recognized by the host. The host is defined as the larger of the organisms involved in a symbiotic interaction.
- symbiont-mediated evasion of host restriction-modification system: A process by which a symbiont evades the DNA restriction modification system of its host. This process occurs in phages to protein themselves from bacterial restriction enzyme systems. Some viruses encode their own methyltransferase in order to protect their genome from host restriction enzymes. Others directly inhibit restriction enzymes while some use unusual bases in their genome to avoid restriction.
- symbiont-mediated evasion of mRNA degradation by host via mRNA cap methylation: An innate immune response evasion mechanism in which a symbiont methylates the 2'-O-ribose of the first or second transcribed nucleotide of its mRNAs. Methylation allows evasion of the host innate immune response, which degrades cap0 (non-methylated) mRNAs. This mechanism of immune evasion is used by viruses.
- symbiont-mediated evasion of recognition by host antimicrobial peptide: A process by which a symbiont avoids the effects of recognition by a host  antimicrobial peptide by altering molecules on the symbiont surface. The host is defined as the larger of the organisms involved in a symbiotic interaction.
- symbiont-mediated evasion of recognition by host complement: A process by which a symbiont avoids the effects of recognition by host  complement by altering molecules on the symbiont surface. The host is defined as the larger of the organisms involved in a symbiotic interaction.
- symbiont-mediated evasion of recognition by host innate immune effector: A process by which a symbiont mitigates the effects of recognition by a host innate immune effector. Effectors have a direct activity against a symbiont and include complement, antimicrobial peptides, and bacterial restriction enzymes. The host is defined as the larger of the organisms involved in a symbiotic interaction.",,"(arbuscular mycorrhizal association, subClassOf, biological process involved in symbiotic interaction)

Classes:
- adenohypophysis: The glandular, anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes including stress, growth, and reproduction[WP]. The anterior lobe of the hypophysis (pituitary gland). This lobe contains cells that produce prolactin, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and proopiomelanocortin[ZFA].
- alveolus: Organ part that has the form of a hollow cavity[WP].
- anterior part of tongue: The portion of the tongue in front of the terminal sulcus. At the apex, thin and narrow, it is directed forward against the lingual surfaces of the lower incisor teeth. It is derived primarily from the first pharyngeal arch.
- lamina of spiral limbus: The osseous spiral lamina consists of two plates of bone, and between these are the canals for the transmission of the filaments of the acoustic nerve. On the upper plate of that part of the lamina which is outside the vestibular membrane, the periosteum is thickened to form the limbus spiralis (or limbus laminæ spiralis), this ends externally in a concavity, the sulcus spiralis internus, which represents, on section, the form of the letter C. [WP,unvetted].
- mammillary body: One of two hemispherical bulges on the base of the posterior hypothalamus (Butler and Hodos, Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy, 2nd ed., 2005, pg 455).
- marginal zone of spleen: The zone between the red and white pulp of the spleen containing numerous macrophages and lymphocytes, and a rich plexus of sinusoids supplied by white pulp arterioles carrying blood-borne antigens.
- mesoderm-derived structure: An anatomical structure that develops (entirely or partially) from the mesoderm.
- multicellular anatomical structure: An anatomical structure that has more than one cell as a part.
- organ part: A multicellular structure that is a part of an organ.
- renal glomerulus: A capillary tuft which forms a close network with the visceral epithelium (podocytes) and the mesangium to form the filtration barrier and is surrounded by Bowman's capsule in nephrons of the vertebrate kidney[GO].
- renal pelvis: A funnel shaped proximal portion of the ureter that is formed by convergence of the major calices [MP].
- sclera: Opaque fibrous outer layer of the eyeball[ZFA,Kardong,WP].
- splenic cord: A structure found in the red pulp of the spleen between the sinusoids, consisting of fibrils and connective tissue cells with a large population of monocytes and macrophages. These cords contain half of the human body's monocytes as a reserve so that after tissue injury these monocytes can move in and aid locally sourced monocytes in wound healing. Erythrocytes pass through the cords of Billroth before entering the sinusoids. The passage into the sinusoids may be seen as a bottleneck, where erythrocytes need to be flexible in order to pass through. In disorders of erythrocyte shape and/or flexibility, such as hereditary spherocytosis, erythrocytes fail to pass through and get phagocytosed, causing extravascular hemolysis.

Classes:
- allosexual sexual orientation: Sexual, experiencing sexual attraction; not asexual.
- blood type: The specific reaction pattern of erythrocytes of an individual to the antisera of one blood group; e.g., the ABO blood group consists of four major blood types: O, A, B, and AB. This classification depends on the presence or absence of two major antigens: A or B. Type O occurs when neither is present and type AB when both are present. The blood type is the genetic phenotype of the individual for one blood group system and may be determined using different antisera available for testing.
- cinsiyet: The theoretical totality of characteristics of reproductive structure, functions, phenotype, and genotype, differentiating the male from the female organism. In practice, many cases occur where a majority of characteristics occur aligning with ""maleness"" or ""femaleness"", with a minority not fitting those expectations. ""Sex"" therefore is often not specific enough of a term to be useful. Consider using something like ""gonadal sex"" or ""chromosomal sex"" instead.
- consent: Permission to do something.
- dominant hand: The preferred hand of use for controlled and efficient performance of motor tasks.
- exploring sexual orientation: Unsure of one's sexual orientation.
- gender state: A rarely used classification system (usually used in a joking manner) to describe one's relationship to their gender via one of the states of matter (being built around the present terminology of genderfluid and adding ""gendersolid"", ""gendergas"", etc.).
- interpersonal orientation: Differences in patterns of orientation for social interaction.
- libido: The psychic drive or energy associated with sexual instinct in the broad sense (pleasure and love-object seeking). It may also connote the psychic energy associated with instincts in general that motivate behavior.
- orientación sexual: One's tendencies of sexual attraction, considered as a whole.
- perisex: The condition of being non-intersex.
- personal attribute: The distinguishing qualities or prominent aspects of an individual person.
- queer sexual orientation: Pertaining to sexual behavior or identity which does not conform to conventional heterosexual norms, assumptions etc.
- sociosexual orientation: The individual difference in the willingness to engage in sexual activity outside of a committed relationship.

- anatomical structure morphogenesis: The process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Morphogenesis pertains to the creation of form.
- body morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the soma are generated and organized.
- bract morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structure of a bract are generated and organized. A bract is a leaf, usually different in form from the foliage leaves, subtending a flower or inflorescence.
- developmental process: A biological process whose specific outcome is the progression of an integrated living unit: an anatomical structure (which may be a subcellular structure, cell, tissue, or organ), or organism over time from an initial condition to a later condition.
- glomerulus morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the glomerulus are generated and organized. The glomerulus is a capillary tuft surrounded by Bowman's capsule in nephrons of the vertebrate kidney.
- hard palate morphogenesis: The developmental process by which a hard palate is generated and organized.
- leaf morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of the leaf are generated and organized.
- locus ceruleus morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structure of the locus ceruleus is generated and organized. In mice, the locus ceruleus is a dense cluster of neurons within the dorsorostral pons. This nucleus is the major location of neurons that release norepinephrine throughout the brain, and is responsible for physiological responses to stress and panic.
- lymph vessel morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of lymph vessels are generated and organized. The lymph vessel is the vasculature carrying lymph.
- nipple morphogenesis: The process in which the nipple is generated and organized.
- plant organ morphogenesis: The developmental process by which a plant organ is generated and organized.
- post-embryonic plant organ morphogenesis: Morphogenesis, during the post-embryonic phase, of a plant tissue or tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis pertains to process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions.
- prostate gland stromal morphogenesis: The process in which the prostate gland stroma is generated and organized. The prostate gland stroma is made up of the mesenchymal or fibroblast cells of the prostate gland.
- root morphogenesis: The process in which the anatomical structures of roots are generated and organized. The root is the usually underground part of a seed plant body that originates from the hypocotyl, functions as an organ of absorption, aeration, and food storage or as a means of anchorage and support.
- swim bladder inflation: The expansion of the swim bladder by trapped gases. The swim bladder is used by some fishes to maintain buoyancy and may function in addition as a sound producing organ, a sound receptor, and a respiratory organ.",,"(anatomical structure morphogenesis, subClassOf, developmental process)
