D. Albert D. J. Cashier was an Irish-born immigrant who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Cashier adopted the identity of a man before enlisting, and maintained it for the remainder of his life. Albert became famous as one of a number of women soldiers who served as men during the Civil War, although the consistent and long-term (at least 53 years) commitment to the male identity has prompted some contemporary scholars to suggest that Cashier was a trans man. On 5 May 1911, Cashier was moved to the Soldiers and Sailors home in Quincy, Illinois until his mental state deteriorated and he was moved to the Watertown State Hospital for the Insane in March 1914. Attendants at the Watertown State Hospital discovered that he had female genitalia when giving him a bath, at which point he was forced to wear women's clothes again after fifty years living as a man.

A term used in Japan to describe young men who express little interest in getting married or being assertive in relationships with women. The term was coined by the author Maki Fukasawa, who initially intended for it to describe a new form of masculinity that was not reliant on the proactivity and assertiveness typically associated with masculinity in Japan. Philosopher Masahiro Morioka defines herbivore men as ""kind and gentle men who, without being bound by manliness, do not pursue romantic relationships voraciously and have no aptitude for being hurt or hurting others."" The term was quickly sensationalized by the media, gaining a negative connotation suggesting young men who had lost their ""manliness"" were responsible for Japan's declining birth rate and stagnating economy. Through mass media, the label of herbivore man came to be associated with irresponsible, overly feminine men who cared too much about their appearances rather than marriage or finding a stable job, which were seen as traditionally masculine goals. The definition of herbivore men is still debated because of this, making it difficult to estimate how many men in Japan identify as herbivore men, particularly considering the social stigma associated with the term.

The spring edition of the prisoner support zine Spirit of Freedom defined the term as ""the tactics that the US government and all their tentacles (FBI, IRS, BATF, Joint Terrorism Task Forces, local police, the court system) are using to attack the ELF/ALF and specifically those who publicly support them."" The term has been used by activists to describe a sweep of arrests, convictions and grand jury indictments of ELF and ALF operatives on charges relating to acts of property damage, conspiracy, arson and use of destructive devices.

B. Any of various promotions of a widespread fear of a potential rise of communism, anarchism or other leftist ideologies by a society or state. The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States which are referred to by this name. The First Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War I, revolved around a perceived threat from the American labor movement, anarchist revolution, and political radicalism. The Second Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War II, was preoccupied with the perception that national or foreign communists were infiltrating or subverting U.S. society and the federal government. The name refers to the red flag as a common symbol of communism.

C. A moral panic during the mid-20th century about homosexual people in the United States government and their mass dismissal from government service. It contributed to and paralleled the anti-communist campaign known as McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare. Gay men and lesbians were said to be national security risks and communist sympathizers, which led to the call to remove them from state employment. It was thought that gay people were more susceptible to being manipulated, which could pose a threat to the country. The Lavender Scare – the federal government's official response to both a visible lesbian and gay community and a perceived homosexual menace – normalized persecution of homosexuals through bureaucratic institutionalization of homophobic discrimination policy.

D. A moral panic consisting of over 12,000 unsubstantiated cases of Satanic ritual abuse tarting in the United States in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s, and persisting today. The panic originated in 1980 with the publication of Michelle Remembers, a book co-written by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and his patient (and future wife), Michelle Smith, which used the discredited practice of recovered-memory therapy to make sweeping lurid claims about satanic ritual abuse involving Smith. The allegations which afterwards arose throughout much of the United States involved reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in the context of occult or Satanic rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a global Satanic cult that includes the wealthy and powerful world elite in which children are abducted or bred for human sacrifices, pornography, and prostitution.",B,1_5,sciences/gsso_ontology,Red Scare,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_011324

A series of violent events sparked by an announcement of a lenient sentencing of Dan White for the assassinations of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and of Harvey Milk, a member of the city's Board of Supervisors who was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. The events took place on the night of May 21, 1979 (the night before what would have been Milk's 49th birthday) in San Francisco. Earlier that day, White had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the lightest possible conviction for his actions. That White was not convicted of first-degree murder (of which he was originally charged) had so outraged the city's gay community that it set off the most violent reaction by gay Americans since the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City (which is credited as the beginning of the modern gay rights movement in the United States).

B. An incident of violence against LGBTQIA+ people that occurred on 10 October 2010 during a pride parade, organized to promote LGBTQ rights in Serbia. The gay pride parade has been the first in Belgrade since 2001; a planned parade in 2009 was cancelled due to the threat of violence. Anti-gay and anti-government protesters fought with about 5,000 armed police, throwing Molotov cocktails, bricks, stones, glass bottles and firecrackers; the police used tear gas and rubber bullets. There were no fatalities.

C. A series of demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ community in response to a police raid that began in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City, New York, United States of America.

A moral panic during the mid-20th century about homosexual people in the United States government and their mass dismissal from government service. It contributed to and paralleled the anti-communist campaign known as McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare. Gay men and lesbians were said to be national security risks and communist sympathizers, which led to the call to remove them from state employment. It was thought that gay people were more susceptible to being manipulated, which could pose a threat to the country. The Lavender Scare – the federal government's official response to both a visible lesbian and gay community and a perceived homosexual menace – normalized persecution of homosexuals through bureaucratic institutionalization of homophobic discrimination policy.

B. Any of various promotions of a widespread fear of a potential rise of communism, anarchism or other leftist ideologies by a society or state. The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States which are referred to by this name. The First Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War I, revolved around a perceived threat from the American labor movement, anarchist revolution, and political radicalism. The Second Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War II, was preoccupied with the perception that national or foreign communists were infiltrating or subverting U.S. society and the federal government. The name refers to the red flag as a common symbol of communism.

C. Legal action by the US government and moral panic against the radical environmental movement. It alludes to the Red Scares, periods of fear over communist infiltration of US society. The term was popularized by environmental activists. It is first known to have appeared in 2002 in the wake of the February 12 congressional hearings titled ""The Threat of Eco-Terrorism"", which discussed groups including the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). The spring edition of the prisoner support zine Spirit of Freedom defined the term as ""the tactics that the US government and all their tentacles (FBI, IRS, BATF, Joint Terrorism Task Forces, local police, the court system) are using to attack the ELF/ALF and specifically those who publicly support them."" The term has been used by activists to describe a sweep of arrests, convictions and grand jury indictments of ELF and ALF operatives on charges relating to acts of property damage, conspiracy, arson and use of destructive devices.

D. A moral panic consisting of over 12,000 unsubstantiated cases of Satanic ritual abuse tarting in the United States in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s, and persisting today. The panic originated in 1980 with the publication of Michelle Remembers, a book co-written by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and his patient (and future wife), Michelle Smith, which used the discredited practice of recovered-memory therapy to make sweeping lurid claims about satanic ritual abuse involving Smith. The allegations which afterwards arose throughout much of the United States involved reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in the context of occult or Satanic rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a global Satanic cult that includes the wealthy and powerful world elite in which children are abducted or bred for human sacrifices, pornography, and prostitution.",A,1_5,sciences/gsso_ontology,Lavender Scare,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_003669

The first name used for the disease now known as AIDS. GRID was first mentioned in a May 11, 1982 article in the New York Times. In this article, the initialism ""A.I.D."" (acquired immunodeficiency disease) is also mentioned. In the early days of the disease (i.e., 1982–1985), the term ""gay plague"" was also used, while similar terms were used for associated conditions later recognized as AIDS-defining clinical conditions, such as ""gay cancer"" for Kaposi's sarcoma and ""gay pneumonia"" for Pneumocystis pneumonia. The term GRID was never used in the scientific biomedical literature. In the popular press, it was only used for a very short period of time. On August 8, 1982, the acronym AIDS (for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) first appeared in the New York Times. It was initially styled as A.I.D.S. The reason for the GRID-to-AIDS change in nomenclature was the realization that the ""gay"" attribution did not fully encompass the demographics of the disease.

The first large scale gay rights demonstration in Canada. The rally occurred on August 28, 1971 in Ottawa, and was organized by the gay rights activist groups Toronto Gay Action (TGA) and Community Homophile Association of Toronto (CHAT). There was a parallel rally in Vancouver that was organized in solidarity with the rally by the Vancouver group Gay Alliance Toward Equality (GATE). The rally plays an important part in the history of queer equity-seeking and gay rights in Canada, as well as the history of feminism in Canada, and has had a lasting legacy in Canadian gay rights activism.

B. On 7 August 2020, a protest against the arrest of LGBTQ activist Margot led to a confrontation with police in central Warsaw and resulted in the arrest of 47 others, some of whom were protesting and others who were bystanders to the event, dubbed ""Polish Stonewall"" in an analogy to the 1969 Stonewall riots. Declarations of LGBT-free zones in 2019 and 2020 and the 2020 Polish presidential election—which saw President Andrzej Duda repeatedly stress his opposition to LGBTQ rights—have led to protest from LGBTQ rights activists, who adopted direct action tactics. On 7 August, a court granted a request for Margot's pre-trial detention for two months. She presented herself for arrest while hundreds of sympathizers protested the arrest. The police initially declined to arrest her, but later tried to do so and were physically, but non-violently blocked by activists. The police then arrested 48 people: Margot, protestors, and others who had not taken part in the demonstration.

C. A rally held at the Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The demonstration was in response to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while walking across the bridge.

B. A rally held at the Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The demonstration was in response to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while walking across the bridge. According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.

C. Note that no riot occurred at the Black Cat Tavern; rather, a civil demonstration to protest police raids on the tavern was held, organized by PRIDE (Personal Rights in Defense and Education). The protest was met by squadrons of armed policemen.

During the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, protests and campaigns arose surrounding the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people in Russia. Concerns for LGBTQ athletes and supporters during the Games began as early as March 2012, when a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a Pride House in Sochi, ruling that ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" would ""undermine the security of Russian society"", and that it conflicted with public morality and the country's policies ""in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection."" The majority of protests, however, centred on the passing of a law in June 2013, which banned the distribution of ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" among minors. The propaganda law had been characterized by the Western media and other critics as a ban on ""gay propaganda"", arguing that it was broad enough to ban any public display of LGBTQ symbols and suppress LGBTQ culture. The law itself was also considered to have caused an increase in homophobic violence, and an increase in the arrest of pro-LGBTQ protesters.

B. A large political rally that took place in Washington, D.C. on October 14, 1979. The first such march on Washington, it drew between 75,000 and 125,000 gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender people, and straight allies to demand equal civil rights and urge the passage of protective civil rights legislation.

C. A term used in Japan to describe young men who express little interest in getting married or being assertive in relationships with women. The term was coined by the author Maki Fukasawa, who initially intended for it to describe a new form of masculinity that was not reliant on the proactivity and assertiveness typically associated with masculinity in Japan. Philosopher Masahiro Morioka defines herbivore men as ""kind and gentle men who, without being bound by manliness, do not pursue romantic relationships voraciously and have no aptitude for being hurt or hurting others."" The term was quickly sensationalized by the media, gaining a negative connotation suggesting young men who had lost their ""manliness"" were responsible for Japan's declining birth rate and stagnating economy. Through mass media, the label of herbivore man came to be associated with irresponsible, overly feminine men who cared too much about their appearances rather than marriage or finding a stable job, which were seen as traditionally masculine goals. The definition of herbivore men is still debated because of this, making it difficult to estimate how many men in Japan identify as herbivore men, particularly considering the social stigma associated with the term.

D. A pink triangle has been a symbol for various LGBTQ identities, initially intended as a badge of shame, but later reclaimed as a positive symbol of self-identity.

A rally held at the Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The demonstration was in response to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while walking across the bridge. According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.

B. During the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, protests and campaigns arose surrounding the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people in Russia. Concerns for LGBTQ athletes and supporters during the Games began as early as March 2012, when a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a Pride House in Sochi, ruling that ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" would ""undermine the security of Russian society"", and that it conflicted with public morality and the country's policies ""in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection."" The majority of protests, however, centred on the passing of a law in June 2013, which banned the distribution of ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" among minors. The propaganda law had been characterized by the Western media and other critics as a ban on ""gay propaganda"", arguing that it was broad enough to ban any public display of LGBTQ symbols and suppress LGBTQ culture. The law itself was also considered to have caused an increase in homophobic violence, and an increase in the arrest of pro-LGBTQ protesters.

C. On 7 August 2020, a protest against the arrest of LGBTQ activist Margot led to a confrontation with police in central Warsaw and resulted in the arrest of 47 others, some of whom were protesting and others who were bystanders to the event, dubbed ""Polish Stonewall"" in an analogy to the 1969 Stonewall riots. Declarations of LGBT-free zones in 2019 and 2020 and the 2020 Polish presidential election—which saw President Andrzej Duda repeatedly stress his opposition to LGBTQ rights—have led to protest from LGBTQ rights activists, who adopted direct action tactics. On 7 August, a court granted a request for Margot's pre-trial detention for two months. She presented herself for arrest while hundreds of sympathizers protested the arrest. The police initially declined to arrest her, but later tried to do so and were physically, but non-violently blocked by activists. The police then arrested 48 people: Margot, protestors, and others who had not taken part in the demonstration.

D. On August 28, 2011, a commemorative march organized by Queer Ontario called We Still Demand was held on Parliament Hill. The march was both celebrating reforms which have won since the original rally and protesting continued inequality and issues, such as having police at Pride events and LGBTQ homelessness.",A,1_5,sciences/gsso_ontology,Hands Across Hawthrone,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_011902

Thousands gathered for the march in Washington, D.C., which went past the White House and on toward the U.S. Capitol.

B. An event to raise awareness and visibility of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people and issues of LGBTQ rights in the US, it was held April 28 through April 30, 2000 in Washington, D.C. A march from the Washington Monument to the front lawn of the United States Capitol took place on April 30, where the crowd was addressed by several members of Congress and, via video, by President Bill Clinton. Estimates of attendance ranged from 200,000 to 1 million people. The event was criticized for a lack of inclusiveness and political focus as well as concerns over financial accountability. Allegations of theft from a vendor and severe financial mismanagement arose after the event. The final accounting showed the event ended with $330,000 in unpaid debt. In terms of the expense per participant, it was the least cost-efficient of any national LGBTQ march to date.

C. A national political rally that occurred October 11, 2009 in Washington, D.C.

The march was called for by activist David Mixner and implemented by Cleve Jones, and organized by Equality Across America and the Courage Campaign.

1_5_zca4bcex,"In the ontology of Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation, which of the following definitions best describes the instance 'Green Scare'?","A. A moral panic during the mid-20th century about homosexual people in the United States government and their mass dismissal from government service. It contributed to and paralleled the anti-communist campaign known as McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare. Gay men and lesbians were said to be national security risks and communist sympathizers, which led to the call to remove them from state employment. It was thought that gay people were more susceptible to being manipulated, which could pose a threat to the country. The Lavender Scare – the federal government's official response to both a visible lesbian and gay community and a perceived homosexual menace – normalized persecution of homosexuals through bureaucratic institutionalization of homophobic discrimination policy.

B. Legal action by the US government and moral panic against the radical environmental movement. It alludes to the Red Scares, periods of fear over communist infiltration of US society. The term was popularized by environmental activists. It is first known to have appeared in 2002 in the wake of the February 12 congressional hearings titled ""The Threat of Eco-Terrorism"", which discussed groups including the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). The spring edition of the prisoner support zine Spirit of Freedom defined the term as ""the tactics that the US government and all their tentacles (FBI, IRS, BATF, Joint Terrorism Task Forces, local police, the court system) are using to attack the ELF/ALF and specifically those who publicly support them."" The term has been used by activists to describe a sweep of arrests, convictions and grand jury indictments of ELF and ALF operatives on charges relating to acts of property damage, conspiracy, arson and use of destructive devices.

C. A moral panic consisting of over 12,000 unsubstantiated cases of Satanic ritual abuse tarting in the United States in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s, and persisting today. The panic originated in 1980 with the publication of Michelle Remembers, a book co-written by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and his patient (and future wife), Michelle Smith, which used the discredited practice of recovered-memory therapy to make sweeping lurid claims about satanic ritual abuse involving Smith. The allegations which afterwards arose throughout much of the United States involved reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in the context of occult or Satanic rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a global Satanic cult that includes the wealthy and powerful world elite in which children are abducted or bred for human sacrifices, pornography, and prostitution.

D. Any of various promotions of a widespread fear of a potential rise of communism, anarchism or other leftist ideologies by a society or state. The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States which are referred to by this name. The First Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War I, revolved around a perceived threat from the American labor movement, anarchist revolution, and political radicalism. The Second Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War II, was preoccupied with the perception that national or foreign communists were infiltrating or subverting U.S. society and the federal government. The name refers to the red flag as a common symbol of communism.",B,1_5,sciences/gsso_ontology,Green Scare,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_011323

B. A lesbian who has never had sex with a man.

C. Consists of a circle with a small cross below it.

In zoology and botany, it is used to represent the female sex (alongside the astrological symbol for Mars representing the male sex), following a convention introduced by Linnaeus in the 1750s.

B. An historical term for extremely marked, frequent, and/or increased libido observed in women. This term is outdated and pathologizing and is not recognized as a specific disorder in the DSM, with the term hypersexuality preferred.  As historian Carol Groneman notes ""Nymphomania conjures up madness while Don Juanism hints of nobility and Spanish courts … 'Men are less stigmatized by this behavior… for all it’s apparent openness, our society doesn’t yet loudly applaud a fully sexual woman"". And as clinical support worker and addiction professional Robert Weiss argued ""[nymphomania is] an antiquated and demeaning word used to denigrate women. It is not a medical or psychiatric diagnosis, and it is certainly not helpful to anyone"".

C. An ill-defined psychiatric diagnosis present in DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-IV-TR. It was renamed transvestic disorder in DSM-V. The diagnostic criteria given were (1) individuals must be sexually aroused by the act of cross-dressing, and (2) individuals must experience significant distress or impairment – socially or occupationally – because of their behavior. Often tied to Ray Blanchard's pseudoscientific autogynephilia theory.

D. A term that was first used by Henry L. Kazal and colleagues in 1976 to describe various sexually transmitted rectal infections seen in Kazal's proctology practice, which had many gay patients.

A concept articulated by Harry Hay, representing the valuable mindset in same-sex relationships, emerging from the inherent similarities of the partners. The notion stands in contrast to the subject–object dynamic prevailing in heterosexual society, where men presume cultural dominance and see only themselves as subjects relative to women, who are in turn treated as objects or property. Hay extrapolated this interpersonal/sexual dynamic into a broader social context, believing that subject–object relationships were the root of society's ills. Objectification served as a barrier, emotionally separating an individual self from another individual by dehumanizing them. Same-sex relationships, however, suggest a different dynamic at work. Hay believed that gay relationships evolve from mutual respect and empathy for the other: a longing for a companion who is as equally valuable as the self, an interpersonal/sexual dynamic based on ""subject–SUBJECT"" consciousness. (Hay capitalized the second term for emphasis in all writings on the topic.) Hay believed that this subject–SUBJECT way of viewing the world is the most valuable contribution LGBTQIA+ people bring to society at large: by empathizing with all people, relating to each other as equal-to-equal, society can change drastically, and social justice can prevail.

B. The primary method used to measure an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism, created by Glick and Fiske in 1996. The ASI is a 22-item self-report measure of sexism on which respondents indicate their level of agreement with various statements, which are placed on a 6-point Likert scale. It is composed of two sub-scales that may be independently calculated for sub-scale scores or may be averaged for an overall composite sexism score. The first sub-scale is the hostile sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items designed to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility, as previously defined. A sample item from the hostile sexism sub-scale is ""Women are too easily offended."" The second sub-scale is the benevolent sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items that aim to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy, as previously defined. A sample item from the benevolent sexism sub-scale is ""Women should be cherished and protected by men.""

D. A term used in Japan to describe young men who express little interest in getting married or being assertive in relationships with women. The term was coined by the author Maki Fukasawa, who initially intended for it to describe a new form of masculinity that was not reliant on the proactivity and assertiveness typically associated with masculinity in Japan. Philosopher Masahiro Morioka defines herbivore men as ""kind and gentle men who, without being bound by manliness, do not pursue romantic relationships voraciously and have no aptitude for being hurt or hurting others."" The term was quickly sensationalized by the media, gaining a negative connotation suggesting young men who had lost their ""manliness"" were responsible for Japan's declining birth rate and stagnating economy. Through mass media, the label of herbivore man came to be associated with irresponsible, overly feminine men who cared too much about their appearances rather than marriage or finding a stable job, which were seen as traditionally masculine goals. The definition of herbivore men is still debated because of this, making it difficult to estimate how many men in Japan identify as herbivore men, particularly considering the social stigma associated with the term.",A,1_5,sciences/gsso_ontology,mak nyah,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_007930

In Raman spectroscopy, the depolarization ratio is the intensity ratio between the perpendicular component and the parallel component of the Raman scattered light.

B. The dimensionless ratio of the inertial force (∼U2/L) to the viscous force (∼ νU/L2) in the Navier–Stokes equations, where U is a characteristic velocity, L is a characteristic length, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid; thus, Re=ULv. The Reynolds number is of great importance in the theory of hydrodynamic stability and the origin of turbulence. The inertia force generates vortex stretching and nonlinear interactions and hence creates randomness. Turbulence occurs when the inertia term dominates the viscous term, that is, when the Reynolds number is large. For many engineering flows, turbulence occurs when Re > Rec, where the critical Reynolds number is roughly Rec = 2100.

Police Department put the number between 800,000 and more than 1 million, making it one of the largest protests in American history. The National Park Service estimated attendance at 300,000, but their figure attracted so much negative attention that it shortly thereafter stopped issuing attendance estimates for similar events.

B. A large political rally that took place in Washington, D.C. on October 14, 1979. The first such march on Washington, it drew between 75,000 and 125,000 gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender people, and straight allies to demand equal civil rights and urge the passage of protective civil rights legislation.

C. A national LGBTQ march which occurred on June 11, 2017, in conjunction with Washington, D.C.'s annual pride parade, Capital Pride. The event was organized by New York gay activist David Bruinooge.

On August 28, 2011, a commemorative march organized by Queer Ontario called We Still Demand was held on Parliament Hill. The march was both celebrating reforms which have won since the original rally and protesting continued inequality and issues, such as having police at Pride events and LGBTQ homelessness.

B. During the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, protests and campaigns arose surrounding the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people in Russia. Concerns for LGBTQ athletes and supporters during the Games began as early as March 2012, when a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a Pride House in Sochi, ruling that ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" would ""undermine the security of Russian society"", and that it conflicted with public morality and the country's policies ""in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection."" The majority of protests, however, centred on the passing of a law in June 2013, which banned the distribution of ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" among minors. The propaganda law had been characterized by the Western media and other critics as a ban on ""gay propaganda"", arguing that it was broad enough to ban any public display of LGBTQ symbols and suppress LGBTQ culture. The law itself was also considered to have caused an increase in homophobic violence, and an increase in the arrest of pro-LGBTQ protesters.

C. On April 25, 1965, the first of two historic Sit-ins occurred at the popular Dewey's Restaurant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was one of the earliest demonstrations advocating for the LGBTQ community in United States history. Three unidentified teenagers and approximately 150 supporters walked into the Dewey's location at 219 South 17th Street, refusing to leave in the name of civil rights. This initial sit-in was in response to Dewey's recently implemented discriminatory policy claiming it would not serve ""homosexuals,"" ""masculine women,"" ""feminine men,"" nor ""persons wearing nonconformist clothing."" Philadelphia police arrested the three teenagers, which led to further grass-roots action. Clark Polak, president of the local Janus Society, extended support to the protesters. Members of the Janus Society and other supporters circulated approximately 1500 flyers throughout the local area over the next five days. On May 2, 1965, protesters staged a second sit-in at Dewey's, although this time there were no arrests. Soon after the second sit-in, Dewey's Restaurant reversed their policy against LGBTQ individuals. The Dewey's sit-ins helped continue the path towards equal rights for many LGBTQ people in the United States.

D. An anti-homophobic rally held in Tbilisi, Georgia, on May 17, 2013, the International Day Against Homophobia. Gay rights activists holding the rally were met by thousands of protestors opposing homosexuality, who were allowed to break through a police cordon and violently pursued them, beating and throwing stones at them.

B. A concept articulated by Harry Hay, representing the valuable mindset in same-sex relationships, emerging from the inherent similarities of the partners. The notion stands in contrast to the subject–object dynamic prevailing in heterosexual society, where men presume cultural dominance and see only themselves as subjects relative to women, who are in turn treated as objects or property. Hay extrapolated this interpersonal/sexual dynamic into a broader social context, believing that subject–object relationships were the root of society's ills. Objectification served as a barrier, emotionally separating an individual self from another individual by dehumanizing them. Same-sex relationships, however, suggest a different dynamic at work. Hay believed that gay relationships evolve from mutual respect and empathy for the other: a longing for a companion who is as equally valuable as the self, an interpersonal/sexual dynamic based on ""subject–SUBJECT"" consciousness. (Hay capitalized the second term for emphasis in all writings on the topic.) Hay believed that this subject–SUBJECT way of viewing the world is the most valuable contribution LGBTQIA+ people bring to society at large: by empathizing with all people, relating to each other as equal-to-equal, society can change drastically, and social justice can prevail.

B. On April 25, 1965, the first of two historic Sit-ins occurred at the popular Dewey's Restaurant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was one of the earliest demonstrations advocating for the LGBTQ community in United States history. Three unidentified teenagers and approximately 150 supporters walked into the Dewey's location at 219 South 17th Street, refusing to leave in the name of civil rights. This initial sit-in was in response to Dewey's recently implemented discriminatory policy claiming it would not serve ""homosexuals,"" ""masculine women,"" ""feminine men,"" nor ""persons wearing nonconformist clothing."" Philadelphia police arrested the three teenagers, which led to further grass-roots action. Clark Polak, president of the local Janus Society, extended support to the protesters. Members of the Janus Society and other supporters circulated approximately 1500 flyers throughout the local area over the next five days. On May 2, 1965, protesters staged a second sit-in at Dewey's, although this time there were no arrests. Soon after the second sit-in, Dewey's Restaurant reversed their policy against LGBTQ individuals. The Dewey's sit-ins helped continue the path towards equal rights for many LGBTQ people in the United States.

During the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, protests and campaigns arose surrounding the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people in Russia. Concerns for LGBTQ athletes and supporters during the Games began as early as March 2012, when a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a Pride House in Sochi, ruling that ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" would ""undermine the security of Russian society"", and that it conflicted with public morality and the country's policies ""in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection."" The majority of protests, however, centred on the passing of a law in June 2013, which banned the distribution of ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" among minors. The propaganda law had been characterized by the Western media and other critics as a ban on ""gay propaganda"", arguing that it was broad enough to ban any public display of LGBTQ symbols and suppress LGBTQ culture. The law itself was also considered to have caused an increase in homophobic violence, and an increase in the arrest of pro-LGBTQ protesters.

B. On April 25, 1965, the first of two historic Sit-ins occurred at the popular Dewey's Restaurant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was one of the earliest demonstrations advocating for the LGBTQ community in United States history. Three unidentified teenagers and approximately 150 supporters walked into the Dewey's location at 219 South 17th Street, refusing to leave in the name of civil rights. This initial sit-in was in response to Dewey's recently implemented discriminatory policy claiming it would not serve ""homosexuals,"" ""masculine women,"" ""feminine men,"" nor ""persons wearing nonconformist clothing."" Philadelphia police arrested the three teenagers, which led to further grass-roots action. Clark Polak, president of the local Janus Society, extended support to the protesters. Members of the Janus Society and other supporters circulated approximately 1500 flyers throughout the local area over the next five days. On May 2, 1965, protesters staged a second sit-in at Dewey's, although this time there were no arrests. Soon after the second sit-in, Dewey's Restaurant reversed their policy against LGBTQ individuals. The Dewey's sit-ins helped continue the path towards equal rights for many LGBTQ people in the United States.

C. An anti-homophobic rally held in Tbilisi, Georgia, on May 17, 2013, the International Day Against Homophobia. Gay rights activists holding the rally were met by thousands of protestors opposing homosexuality, who were allowed to break through a police cordon and violently pursued them, beating and throwing stones at them. The rally, organized by Georgian LGBTQ-rights organization Identoba, was the first officially sanctioned anti-homophobic demonstration held in Georgia.

D. Any of a series of early pickets organized by LGBTQ organizations, held yearly from 1965 through 1969. The Reminder took place each July 4 at Independence Hall in Philadelphia and were among the earliest LGBTQ demonstrations in the United States. The events were designed to inform and remind the American people that LGBTQ people did not enjoy basic civil rights protections. The Reminders were held each year from 1965 through 1969, with the final picket taking place shortly after the June 28 Stonewall riots, considered the flashpoint of the modern gay liberation movement. Reminder organizers decided to discontinue the July 4 pickets at this point, and shifted their focus to organizing the Christopher Street Liberation Day demonstration held June 28, 1970, to commemorate the anniversary of the riot.

Any of various promotions of a widespread fear of a potential rise of communism, anarchism or other leftist ideologies by a society or state. The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States which are referred to by this name. The First Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War I, revolved around a perceived threat from the American labor movement, anarchist revolution, and political radicalism. The Second Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War II, was preoccupied with the perception that national or foreign communists were infiltrating or subverting U.S. society and the federal government. The name refers to the red flag as a common symbol of communism.

B. Legal action by the US government and moral panic against the radical environmental movement. It alludes to the Red Scares, periods of fear over communist infiltration of US society. The term was popularized by environmental activists. It is first known to have appeared in 2002 in the wake of the February 12 congressional hearings titled ""The Threat of Eco-Terrorism"", which discussed groups including the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). The spring edition of the prisoner support zine Spirit of Freedom defined the term as ""the tactics that the US government and all their tentacles (FBI, IRS, BATF, Joint Terrorism Task Forces, local police, the court system) are using to attack the ELF/ALF and specifically those who publicly support them."" The term has been used by activists to describe a sweep of arrests, convictions and grand jury indictments of ELF and ALF operatives on charges relating to acts of property damage, conspiracy, arson and use of destructive devices.

C. A moral panic during the mid-20th century about homosexual people in the United States government and their mass dismissal from government service. It contributed to and paralleled the anti-communist campaign known as McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare. Gay men and lesbians were said to be national security risks and communist sympathizers, which led to the call to remove them from state employment. It was thought that gay people were more susceptible to being manipulated, which could pose a threat to the country. The Lavender Scare – the federal government's official response to both a visible lesbian and gay community and a perceived homosexual menace – normalized persecution of homosexuals through bureaucratic institutionalization of homophobic discrimination policy.

D. A moral panic consisting of over 12,000 unsubstantiated cases of Satanic ritual abuse tarting in the United States in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s, and persisting today. The panic originated in 1980 with the publication of Michelle Remembers, a book co-written by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and his patient (and future wife), Michelle Smith, which used the discredited practice of recovered-memory therapy to make sweeping lurid claims about satanic ritual abuse involving Smith. The allegations which afterwards arose throughout much of the United States involved reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in the context of occult or Satanic rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a global Satanic cult that includes the wealthy and powerful world elite in which children are abducted or bred for human sacrifices, pornography, and prostitution.",D,1_5,sciences/gsso_ontology,Satanic panic,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_011322

C. A concept articulated by Harry Hay, representing the valuable mindset in same-sex relationships, emerging from the inherent similarities of the partners. The notion stands in contrast to the subject–object dynamic prevailing in heterosexual society, where men presume cultural dominance and see only themselves as subjects relative to women, who are in turn treated as objects or property. Hay extrapolated this interpersonal/sexual dynamic into a broader social context, believing that subject–object relationships were the root of society's ills. Objectification served as a barrier, emotionally separating an individual self from another individual by dehumanizing them. Same-sex relationships, however, suggest a different dynamic at work. Hay believed that gay relationships evolve from mutual respect and empathy for the other: a longing for a companion who is as equally valuable as the self, an interpersonal/sexual dynamic based on ""subject–SUBJECT"" consciousness. (Hay capitalized the second term for emphasis in all writings on the topic.) Hay believed that this subject–SUBJECT way of viewing the world is the most valuable contribution LGBTQIA+ people bring to society at large: by empathizing with all people, relating to each other as equal-to-equal, society can change drastically, and social justice can prevail.

B. A submissive role in a relationship between males in yaoi or shōnen-ai media, derived from the martial arts term.

C. A term used in Japan to describe young men who express little interest in getting married or being assertive in relationships with women. The term was coined by the author Maki Fukasawa, who initially intended for it to describe a new form of masculinity that was not reliant on the proactivity and assertiveness typically associated with masculinity in Japan. Philosopher Masahiro Morioka defines herbivore men as ""kind and gentle men who, without being bound by manliness, do not pursue romantic relationships voraciously and have no aptitude for being hurt or hurting others."" The term was quickly sensationalized by the media, gaining a negative connotation suggesting young men who had lost their ""manliness"" were responsible for Japan's declining birth rate and stagnating economy. Through mass media, the label of herbivore man came to be associated with irresponsible, overly feminine men who cared too much about their appearances rather than marriage or finding a stable job, which were seen as traditionally masculine goals. The definition of herbivore men is still debated because of this, making it difficult to estimate how many men in Japan identify as herbivore men, particularly considering the social stigma associated with the term.

I'm not too sure such negative stereotyping of the Hijra community (or the term) is called for. Can there never be a middle ground in this movement?

On August 28, 2011, a commemorative march organized by Queer Ontario called We Still Demand was held on Parliament Hill. The march was both celebrating reforms which have won since the original rally and protesting continued inequality and issues, such as having police at Pride events and LGBTQ homelessness.

B. The first large scale gay rights demonstration in Canada. The rally occurred on August 28, 1971 in Ottawa, and was organized by the gay rights activist groups Toronto Gay Action (TGA) and Community Homophile Association of Toronto (CHAT). There was a parallel rally in Vancouver that was organized in solidarity with the rally by the Vancouver group Gay Alliance Toward Equality (GATE). The rally plays an important part in the history of queer equity-seeking and gay rights in Canada, as well as the history of feminism in Canada, and has had a lasting legacy in Canadian gay rights activism.

C. During the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, protests and campaigns arose surrounding the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people in Russia. Concerns for LGBTQ athletes and supporters during the Games began as early as March 2012, when a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a Pride House in Sochi, ruling that ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" would ""undermine the security of Russian society"", and that it conflicted with public morality and the country's policies ""in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection."" The majority of protests, however, centred on the passing of a law in June 2013, which banned the distribution of ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" among minors. The propaganda law had been characterized by the Western media and other critics as a ban on ""gay propaganda"", arguing that it was broad enough to ban any public display of LGBTQ symbols and suppress LGBTQ culture. The law itself was also considered to have caused an increase in homophobic violence, and an increase in the arrest of pro-LGBTQ protesters.

D. On 7 August 2020, a protest against the arrest of LGBTQ activist Margot led to a confrontation with police in central Warsaw and resulted in the arrest of 47 others, some of whom were protesting and others who were bystanders to the event, dubbed ""Polish Stonewall"" in an analogy to the 1969 Stonewall riots. Declarations of LGBT-free zones in 2019 and 2020 and the 2020 Polish presidential election—which saw President Andrzej Duda repeatedly stress his opposition to LGBTQ rights—have led to protest from LGBTQ rights activists, who adopted direct action tactics. On 7 August, a court granted a request for Margot's pre-trial detention for two months. She presented herself for arrest while hundreds of sympathizers protested the arrest. The police initially declined to arrest her, but later tried to do so and were physically, but non-violently blocked by activists.

C. The first name used for the disease now known as AIDS. GRID was first mentioned in a May 11, 1982 article in the New York Times. In this article, the initialism ""A.I.D.""

The term GRID was never used in the scientific biomedical literature. In the popular press, it was only used for a very short period of time. On August 8, 1982, the acronym AIDS (for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) first appeared in the New York Times. It was initially styled as A.I.D.S.

B. During the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, protests and campaigns arose surrounding the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people in Russia. Concerns for LGBTQ athletes and supporters during the Games began as early as March 2012, when a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a Pride House in Sochi, ruling that ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" would ""undermine the security of Russian society"", and that it conflicted with public morality and the country's policies ""in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection."" The majority of protests, however, centred on the passing of a law in June 2013, which banned the distribution of ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" among minors. The propaganda law had been characterized by the Western media and other critics as a ban on ""gay propaganda"", arguing that it was broad enough to ban any public display of LGBTQ symbols and suppress LGBTQ culture. The law itself was also considered to have caused an increase in homophobic violence, and an increase in the arrest of pro-LGBTQ protesters.

Moll believed sexual nature involved two entirely distinct parts: sexual stimulation and sexual attraction.

B. An Austrian medical doctor, psychotherapist, and founder of the school of individual psychology. His emphasis on the importance of feelings of inferiority, the inferiority complex, is recognized as an isolating element which plays a key role in personality development. Alfred Adler considered a human being as an individual whole, therefore he called his psychology ""Individual Psychology""

C. A concept articulated by Harry Hay, representing the valuable mindset in same-sex relationships, emerging from the inherent similarities of the partners. The notion stands in contrast to the subject–object dynamic prevailing in heterosexual society, where men presume cultural dominance and see only themselves as subjects relative to women, who are in turn treated as objects or property. Hay extrapolated this interpersonal/sexual dynamic into a broader social context, believing that subject–object relationships were the root of society's ills. Objectification served as a barrier, emotionally separating an individual self from another individual by dehumanizing them. Same-sex relationships, however, suggest a different dynamic at work. Hay believed that gay relationships evolve from mutual respect and empathy for the other: a longing for a companion who is as equally valuable as the self, an interpersonal/sexual dynamic based on ""subject–SUBJECT"" consciousness. (Hay capitalized the second term for emphasis in all writings on the topic.) Hay believed that this subject–SUBJECT way of viewing the world is the most valuable contribution LGBTQIA+ people bring to society at large: by empathizing with all people, relating to each other as equal-to-equal, society can change drastically, and social justice can prevail.

1_5_jnrjr7zi,"In the ontology of Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation, which of the following definitions best describes the instance '2014 Winter Olympics LGBTQ Rights Protests'?","A. On 7 August 2020, a protest against the arrest of LGBTQ activist Margot led to a confrontation with police in central Warsaw and resulted in the arrest of 47 others, some of whom were protesting and others who were bystanders to the event, dubbed ""Polish Stonewall"" in an analogy to the 1969 Stonewall riots. Declarations of LGBT-free zones in 2019 and 2020 and the 2020 Polish presidential election—which saw President Andrzej Duda repeatedly stress his opposition to LGBTQ rights—have led to protest from LGBTQ rights activists, who adopted direct action tactics. On 7 August, a court granted a request for Margot's pre-trial detention for two months. She presented herself for arrest while hundreds of sympathizers protested the arrest. The police initially declined to arrest her, but later tried to do so and were physically, but non-violently blocked by activists. The police then arrested 48 people: Margot, protestors, and others who had not taken part in the demonstration.

B. During the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, protests and campaigns arose surrounding the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people in Russia. Concerns for LGBTQ athletes and supporters during the Games began as early as March 2012, when a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a Pride House in Sochi, ruling that ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" would ""undermine the security of Russian society"", and that it conflicted with public morality and the country's policies ""in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection."" The majority of protests, however, centred on the passing of a law in June 2013, which banned the distribution of ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" among minors. The propaganda law had been characterized by the Western media and other critics as a ban on ""gay propaganda"", arguing that it was broad enough to ban any public display of LGBTQ symbols and suppress LGBTQ culture. The law itself was also considered to have caused an increase in homophobic violence, and an increase in the arrest of pro-LGBTQ protesters.

C. On 9 September 1971 the UK Gay Liberation Front (GLF) undertook an action to disrupt the launch of the Church-based morality campaign, Nationwide Festival of Light at the Methodist Central Hall, Westminster. A number of well-known British figures were involved in the disrupted rally, and the action involved the use of ""radical drag"" drawing on the Stonewall riots and subsequent GLF actions in the USA. Peter Tatchell, gay human rights campaigner, was involved in the action which was one of a series which influenced the development of gay activism in the UK, received media attention at the time, and is still discussed by some of those involved.

D. Note that no riot occurred at the Black Cat Tavern; rather, a civil demonstration to protest police raids on the tavern was held, organized by PRIDE (Personal Rights in Defense and Education).

A strike organized in September 2006 by dozens of wives and girlfriends of gang members from Pereira, Colombia, to curb gang violence, in response to 480 deaths due to gang violence in the coffee region.

According to them, many gang members were involved in violent crime for status and sexual attractiveness, and the strike sent the message that refusing to turn in the guns was not sexy. In 2010 the city's murder rate saw the steepest decline in Colombia, down by 26.5%.

The Reynolds number is of great importance in the theory of hydrodynamic stability and the origin of turbulence. The inertia force generates vortex stretching and nonlinear interactions and hence creates randomness. Turbulence occurs when the inertia term dominates the viscous term, that is, when the Reynolds number is large. For many engineering flows, turbulence occurs when Re > Rec, where the critical Reynolds number is roughly Rec = 2100.
